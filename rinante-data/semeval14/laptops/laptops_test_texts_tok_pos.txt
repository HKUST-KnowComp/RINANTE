tech support would not fix the problem unless i bought your plan for $ 150 plus .

set up was easy .
0 3 4 6 7 10 11 15 15 16
did not enjoy the new windows 8 and touchscreen functions .
0 3 4 7 8 13 14 17 18 21 22 29 30 31 32 35 36 47 48 57 57 58
i expected so as it 's an apple product , but i was glad to see my expectations exceeded , this is the laptop to buy right now .

other than not being a fan of click pads -lrb- industry standard these days -rrb- and the lousy internal speakers , it 's hard for me to find things about this notebook i do n't like , especially considering the $ 350 price tag .

this mac has been a problem since we got it .
0 4 5 8 9 12 13 17 18 19 20 27 28 33 34 36 37 40 41 43 43 44
sure it 's not light and slim but the features make up for it 100 % .
0 4 5 7 7 9 10 13 14 19 20 23 24 28 29 32 33 36 37 45 46 50 51 53 54 57 58 60 61 64 64 65 65 66
i am pleased with the fast log on , speedy wifi connection and the long battery life -lrb- > 6 hrs -rrb- .

the apple engineers have not yet discovered the delete key .
0 3 4 9 10 19 20 24 25 28 29 32 33 43 44 47 48 54 55 58 58 59
made interneting -lrb- part of my business -rrb- very difficult to maintain .
0 4 5 16 17 18 18 22 23 25 26 28 29 37 37 38 39 43 44 53 54 56 57 65 65 66
luckily , for all of us contemplating the decision , the mac mini is priced just right .
0 7 7 8 9 12 13 16 17 19 20 22 23 36 37 40 41 49 49 50 51 54 55 58 59 63 64 66 67 73 74 78 79 84 84 85
small and still very powerful .
0 5 6 9 10 15 16 20 21 29 29 30
i had gotten this model for $ 1199.00 on my state 's tax-free weekend and had a $ 100 off coupon for a macbook at the local bestbuy !
0 1 2 5 6 12 13 17 18 23 24 27 29 30 30 37 38 40 41 43 44 49 49 51 52 60 61 68 69 72 73 76 77 78 79 80 80 83 84 87 88 94 95 98 99 100 101 108 109 111 112 115 116 121 122 129 129 130

0 5 6 11 11 12 13 18 19 23 24 27 28 38 39 43 44 49 49 50
only problem that i had was that the track pad was not very good for me , i only had a problem once or twice with it , but probably my computer was a bit defective .
0 4 5 12 13 17 18 19 20 23 24 27 28 32 33 36 37 42 43 46 47 50 51 54 55 59 60 64 65 68 69 71 71 72 73 74 75 79 80 83 84 85 86 93 94 98 99 101 102 107 108 112 113 115 115 116 117 120 121 129 130 132 133 141 142 145 146 147 148 151 152 161 161 162
and if you are switching from a pc i hilghy sugest this one .
0 3 4 6 7 10 11 14 15 24 25 29 30 31 32 34 35 36 37 43 44 50 51 55 56 59 59 60
it is super fast and has outstanding graphics .
0 2 3 5 6 11 12 16 17 20 21 24 25 36 37 45 45 46
but the mountain lion is just too slow .
0 3 4 7 8 16 17 21 22 24 25 29 30 33 34 38 38 39
strong build though which really adds to its durability .
0 6 7 12 13 19 20 25 26 32 33 37 38 40 41 44 45 55 55 56
the battery life is excellent - 6-7 hours without charging .
0 3 4 11 12 16 17 19 20 29 29 30 31 34 35 40 41 48 49 57 57 58

0 1 2 6 7 12 13 15 16 20 21 23 24 25 26 28 29 34 34 35
and i may be the only one but i am really liking windows 8 .
0 3 4 5 6 9 10 12 13 16 17 21 22 25 26 29 30 31 32 34 35 41 42 48 49 56 57 58 58 59
the baterry is very longer .
0 3 4 11 12 14 15 19 20 26 26 27
and it 's so quiet that i do n't hear it at all .
0 3 4 6 6 8 9 11 12 17 18 22 23 24 25 27 27 30 31 35 36 38 39 41 42 45 45 46
its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable .

i know apples are more expensive than pcs , but he thinks it is worth every penny .

0 2 3 5 6 8 8 10 11 12 13 22 22 25 26 29 30 35 36 38 39 42 43 45 45 48 49 52 53 57 58 62 63 66 67 72 73 76 77 84 85 88 89 92 93 98 99 101 102 107 108 111 111 114 115 123 124 127 127 130
i can say that i am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied .
0 1 2 5 6 9 10 14 15 16 17 19 20 25 26 35 36 40 41 44 45 56 57 61 62 65 66 74 75 78 79 87 87 88
i 'm pretty sure when i bought it , my bank account went ` ouch !
0 1 1 3 4 10 11 15 16 20 21 22 23 29 30 32 32 33 34 36 37 41 42 49 50 54 55 56 56 60 60 61
thank you so much for the great item .
0 5 6 9 10 12 13 17 18 21 22 25 26 31 32 36 36 37
this laptop has only 2 usb ports , and they are both on the same side .
0 4 5 11 12 15 16 20 21 22 23 26 27 32 32 33 34 37 38 42 43 46 47 51 52 54 55 58 59 63 64 68 68 69
it 's annoying very much and i wo n't ever buy any acer products .
0 2 2 4 5 13 14 18 19 23 24 27 28 29 30 32 32 35 36 40 41 44 45 48 49 53 54 62 62 63
this is why i purchased a brand new laptop in the first place so it would n't have any problems .
0 4 5 7 8 11 12 13 14 23 24 25 26 31 32 35 36 42 43 45 46 49 50 55 56 61 62 64 65 67 68 73 73 76 77 81 82 85 86 94 94 95
it has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp .
0 2 3 6 7 9 10 14 15 19 20 25 26 29 30 33 34 40 41 43 44 48 49 54 54 55
as for the laptop , this is our 3rd apple computer in the past 2 years .
0 2 3 6 7 10 11 17 17 18 19 23 24 26 27 30 31 34 35 40 41 49 50 52 53 56 57 61 62 63 64 69 69 70
everything i wanted and everything i needed and the price was great !
0 10 11 12 13 19 20 23 24 34 35 36 37 43 44 47 48 51 52 57 58 61 62 67 67 68
it 's not inexpensive but the hardware performance is impressive for a computer this small .
0 2 2 4 5 8 9 20 21 24 25 28 29 37 38 49 50 52 53 63 64 67 68 69 70 78 79 83 84 89 89 90
it is better than my old acer laptop .
0 2 3 5 6 12 13 17 18 20 21 24 25 29 30 36 36 37
this thing is awesome , everything always works , everything is always easy to set up , everything is compatible , its literally everything i could ask for .
0 4 5 10 11 13 14 21 21 22 23 33 34 40 41 46 46 47 48 58 59 61 62 68 69 73 74 76 77 80 81 83 83 84 85 95 96 98 99 109 109 110 111 114 115 124 125 135 136 137 138 143 144 147 148 151 151 152
i would buy it again in a heartbeat !
0 1 2 7 8 11 12 14 15 20 21 23 24 25 26 35 35 36
keyboard responds well to presses .
0 8 9 17 18 22 23 25 26 33 33 34
if someone called me an apple fanboy ... it would make sense .
0 2 3 10 11 17 18 20 21 23 24 29 30 36 36 39 39 41 42 47 48 52 53 58 58 59
lastly , windows 8 is annoying .
0 6 6 7 8 15 16 17 18 20 21 29 29 30
a scratch on a $ 1,500 macbook is unforgivable .
0 1 2 9 10 12 13 14 15 16 16 21 22 29 30 32 33 45 45 46
i just fell in love with this thing .
0 1 2 6 7 11 12 14 15 19 20 24 25 29 30 35 35 36
everything is so easy and intuitive to setup or configure .

i have no problems yet on my mac so far , and hope it stays like that .
0 1 2 6 7 9 10 18 19 22 23 25 26 28 29 32 33 35 36 39 39 40 41 44 45 49 50 52 53 58 59 63 64 68 68 69
this laptop is a great buy .
0 4 5 11 12 14 15 16 17 22 23 26 26 27
biggest complaint is windows 8 .
0 7 8 17 18 20 21 28 29 30 31 32
only 2 usb ports ... seems kind of ... limited .
0 4 5 6 7 10 11 16 16 19 19 24 25 29 30 32 32 35 35 42 42 43
it has been to early to see if this actually fixes the problem or not though .
0 2 3 6 7 11 12 14 15 20 21 23 24 27 28 30 31 35 36 44 45 50 51 54 55 62 63 65 66 69 70 76 76 77
this device has met my expectations and i 'm sure it will meet yours .
0 4 5 11 12 15 16 19 20 22 23 35 36 39 40 41 41 43 44 48 49 51 52 56 57 61 62 67 67 68
it has all the expected features and more + plus a wide screen and more than roomy keyboard .
0 2 3 6 7 10 11 14 15 23 24 32 33 36 37 41 42 43 43 47 48 49 50 54 55 61 62 65 66 70 71 75 76 81 82 90 90 91
out of all the laptops i have owned , this is by far the best !
0 3 4 6 7 10 11 14 15 22 23 24 25 29 30 35 35 36 37 41 42 44 45 47 48 51 52 55 56 60 60 61
amazing performance for anything i throw at it .
0 7 8 19 20 23 24 32 33 34 35 40 41 43 44 46 46 47
i can never go back to a pc now , this machine never freezes or has any problems .
0 1 2 5 6 11 12 14 15 19 20 22 23 24 25 27 28 31 31 32 33 37 38 45 46 51 52 59 60 62 63 66 67 70 71 79 79 80
out of the box i noticed how small it was and was exactly what i was looking for .
0 3 4 6 7 10 11 14 15 16 17 24 25 28 29 34 35 37 38 41 42 45 46 49 50 57 58 62 63 64 65 68 69 76 77 80 80 81
the receiver was full of superlatives for the quality and performance .
0 3 4 12 13 16 17 21 22 24 25 37 38 41 42 45 46 53 54 57 58 69 69 70
i was extremely happy with the os itself .
0 1 2 5 6 15 16 21 22 26 27 30 31 33 34 40 40 41
i was looking for something in between a regular laptop and a tablet and this is it .
0 1 2 5 6 13 14 17 18 27 28 30 31 38 39 40 41 48 49 55 56 59 60 61 62 68 69 72 73 77 78 80 81 83 83 84
the new mbp offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase a new laptop in 18 months .
0 3 4 7 8 11 12 18 19 24 25 36 37 40 41 46 47 49 50 60 61 65 66 68 69 72 73 76 77 82 83 85 86 90 91 93 94 102 103 104 105 108 109 115 116 118 119 121 122 128 128 129
great purchase and i definitely did n't miss out on the black friday deals .
0 5 6 14 15 18 19 20 21 31 32 35 35 38 39 43 44 47 48 50 51 54 55 60 61 67 68 73 73 74
the criticism has waned , and now i 'd be the first to recommend an air for truly portable computing .
0 3 4 13 14 17 18 23 23 24 25 28 29 32 33 34 34 36 37 39 40 43 44 49 50 52 53 62 63 65 66 69 70 73 74 79 80 88 89 98 98 99
i would have given it 5 starts was it not for the fact that it had windows 8
0 1 2 7 8 12 13 18 19 21 22 23 24 30 31 34 35 37 38 41 42 45 46 49 50 54 55 59 60 62 63 66 67 74 75 76
ms office 2011 for mac is wonderful , well worth it .
0 2 3 9 10 14 15 18 19 22 23 25 26 35 35 36 37 41 42 47 48 50 50 51
after using it for over a month , an issue started to surface .
0 5 6 11 12 14 15 18 19 23 24 25 26 31 31 32 33 35 36 41 42 49 50 52 53 60 60 61
but the performance of mac mini is a huge disappointment .
0 3 4 7 8 19 20 22 23 26 27 31 32 34 35 36 37 41 42 56 56 57
there has been no problem with anything .
0 5 6 9 10 14 15 17 18 25 26 30 31 39 39 40
i believe with apple - you get what you pay for .
0 1 2 9 10 14 15 20 21 22 23 26 27 30 31 35 36 39 40 43 44 47 47 48
they do n't just look good ; they deliver excellent performance .

the mountain lion os is not hard to figure out if you are familiar with microsoft windows .
0 3 4 12 13 17 18 20 21 23 24 27 28 32 33 35 36 42 43 46 47 49 50 53 54 57 58 66 67 71 72 81 82 89 89 90
however , i can refute that osx is `` fast '' .
0 7 7 8 9 10 11 14 15 21 22 26 27 30 31 33 34 35 35 39 39 40 40 41
i waited to review to make sure it is what it is .
0 1 2 8 9 11 12 18 19 21 22 26 27 31 32 34 35 37 38 42 43 45 46 48 48 49

incredible graphics and brilliant colors .
0 10 11 19 20 23 24 33 34 40 40 41
i needed something affordable from apple and was tired of dealing with pc laptop after pc laptop .
0 1 2 8 9 18 19 29 30 34 35 40 41 44 45 48 49 54 55 57 58 65 66 70 71 73 74 80 81 86 87 89 90 96 96 97
just bit the bullet and bought the mac hoping it will last a lot longer ... .
0 4 5 8 9 12 13 19 20 23 24 30 31 34 35 38 39 45 46 48 49 53 54 58 59 60 61 64 65 71 71 72 72 73
built-in apps are purely amazing .
0 8 9 13 14 17 18 24 25 32 32 33
cons : screen resolution .
0 4 4 5 6 12 13 23 23 24
from the speed to the multi touch gestures this operating system beats windows easily .
0 4 5 8 9 14 15 17 18 21 22 27 28 33 34 42 43 47 48 57 58 64 65 70 71 78 79 85 85 86
i really like the size and i 'm a fan of the acers .
0 1 2 8 9 13 14 17 18 22 23 26 27 28 28 30 31 32 33 36 37 39 40 43 44 49 49 50
this is by far thee best , most reliable computer i could find .
0 4 5 7 8 10 11 14 15 19 20 24 24 25 26 30 31 39 40 48 49 50 51 56 57 61 61 62
i opted for the squaretrade 3-year computer accidental protection warranty -lrb- $ 1500-2000 -rrb- which also support `` accidents '' like drops and spills that are not covered by applecare .
0 1 2 7 8 11 12 15 16 27 28 34 35 43 44 54 55 65 66 74 75 76 76 77 77 86 86 87 88 93 94 98 99 106 107 108 108 117 117 118 119 123 124 129 130 133 134 140 141 145 146 149 150 153 154 161 162 164 165 174 174 175
it 's light and easy to transport .
0 2 2 4 5 10 11 14 15 19 20 22 23 32 32 33
once you get past learning how to use the poorly designed windows 8 set-up you may feel frustrated .
0 4 5 8 9 12 13 17 18 26 27 30 31 33 34 37 38 41 42 48 49 57 58 65 66 67 68 74 75 78 79 82 83 87 88 98 98 99
very powerful especially for the money .
0 4 5 13 14 24 25 28 29 32 33 38 38 39
when my dell laptop gave up only after 2 1/2 years , i decided to buy macbook pro .
0 4 5 7 8 12 13 19 20 24 25 27 28 32 33 38 39 44 45 50 50 51 52 53 54 61 62 64 65 68 69 76 77 80 80 81
it 's been time for a new laptop , and the only debate was which size of the mac laptops , and whether to spring for the retina display .
0 2 2 4 5 9 10 14 15 18 19 20 21 24 25 31 31 32 33 36 37 40 41 45 46 52 53 56 57 62 63 67 68 70 71 74 75 78 79 86 86 87 88 91 92 99 100 102 103 109 110 113 114 117 118 124 125 132 132 133
this was a significantly more affordable than getting a new macbook pro from apple .
0 4 5 8 9 10 11 24 25 29 30 40 41 45 46 53 54 55 56 59 60 67 68 71 72 76 77 82 82 83
i have always wanted a macbook pro ... always !
0 1 2 6 7 13 14 20 21 22 23 30 31 34 34 39 39 45 45 46
the reason why i choose apple macbook because of their design and the aluminum casing .
0 3 4 10 11 14 15 16 17 23 24 29 30 37 38 45 46 48 49 54 55 61 62 65 66 69 70 78 79 85 85 86
the aluminum body sure makes it stand out .
0 3 4 12 13 17 18 22 23 28 29 31 32 37 38 41 41 42
overall it 's an amazing product , 5 stars !
0 7 8 10 10 12 13 15 16 23 24 31 31 32 33 34 35 40 40 41
it is very easy to integrate bluetooth devices , and usb devices are recognized almost instantly .
0 2 3 5 6 10 11 15 16 18 19 28 29 38 39 46 46 47 48 51 52 55 56 63 64 67 68 78 79 85 86 95 95 96
he 's thrilled with his new laptop .
0 2 2 4 5 13 14 18 19 22 23 26 27 33 33 34
amazing product as you would expect from apple .
0 7 8 15 16 18 19 22 23 28 29 35 36 40 41 46 46 47
nothing wrong with this computer at all !
0 7 8 13 14 18 19 23 24 32 33 35 36 39 39 40
and the fact that apple is driving the 13 '' rmbp with the intel4000 graphic chip seems underpowered -lrb- to me .
0 3 4 7 8 12 13 17 18 23 24 26 27 34 35 38 39 41 41 42 43 47 48 52 53 56 57 66 67 74 75 79 80 85 86 98 99 100 100 102 103 105 105 106
i have to wonder why amazon is even selling this dinosaur .
0 1 2 6 7 9 10 16 17 20 21 27 28 30 31 35 36 43 44 48 49 57 57 58
apple removed the dvd drive firewire port -lrb- will work with adapter -rrb- and put the sdxc slot in a silly position on the back .
0 5 6 13 14 17 18 21 22 27 28 36 37 41 42 43 43 47 48 52 53 57 58 65 65 66 67 70 71 74 75 78 79 83 84 88 89 91 92 93 94 99 100 108 109 111 112 115 116 120 120 121
no hassle and no complaints .
0 2 3 9 10 13 14 16 17 27 27 28
love it i 've always been an apple fan boy , but never had the money to buy a mac , only ipads and iphones , and this is my first mac , blew me away completely .
0 4 5 7 8 9 9 12 13 19 20 24 25 27 28 33 34 37 38 41 41 42 43 46 47 52 53 56 57 60 61 66 67 69 70 73 74 75 76 79 79 80 81 85 86 91 92 95 96 103 103 104 105 108 109 113 114 116 117 119 120 125 126 129 129 130 131 135 136 138 139 143 144 154 154 155
the durability of the laptop will make it worth the money .
0 3 4 14 15 17 18 21 22 28 29 33 34 38 39 41 42 47 48 51 52 57 57 58
well designed and fast .
0 4 5 13 14 17 18 22 22 23
and now i am a proud macbook owner also !
0 3 4 7 8 9 10 12 13 14 15 20 21 28 29 34 35 39 39 40
but i was completely wrong , this computer is unbelievable amazing and easy to use .
0 3 4 5 6 9 10 20 21 26 26 27 28 32 33 41 42 44 45 57 58 65 66 69 70 74 75 77 78 81 81 82
exactly as posted plus a great value .
0 7 8 10 11 17 18 22 23 24 25 30 31 36 36 37
the specs are pretty good too .
0 3 4 9 10 13 14 20 21 25 26 29 29 30
i am having a friend look at it , but will probably return it .
0 1 2 4 5 11 12 13 14 20 21 25 26 28 29 31 32 33 34 37 38 42 43 51 52 58 59 61 61 62
there were no scratches or dents or any marks at all .
0 5 6 10 11 13 14 23 24 26 27 32 33 35 36 39 40 45 46 48 49 52 52 53
i 've only had it one day , but i really do love it and i 'm happy it was economical and i 'm finally able to own a mac !
0 1 1 4 5 9 10 13 14 16 17 20 21 24 24 25 26 29 30 31 32 38 39 41 42 46 47 49 50 53 54 55 55 57 58 63 64 66 67 70 71 81 82 85 86 87 87 89 90 97 98 102 103 105 106 109 110 111 112 115 115 116
since i have always used apple products , the choice of macbook pro was obvious .
0 5 6 7 8 12 13 19 20 24 25 30 31 39 39 40 41 44 45 51 52 54 55 62 63 66 67 70 71 78 78 79
apple is unmatched in product quality , aesthetics , craftmanship , and customer service .
0 5 6 8 9 18 19 21 22 29 30 37 37 38 38 48 48 49 49 61 61 62 63 66 67 75 76 83 83 84
this is my first apple laptop .
0 4 5 7 8 10 11 16 17 22 23 29 29 30
it makes a great gift .
0 2 3 8 9 10 11 16 17 21 21 22
it is a great size and amazing windows 8 included !
0 2 3 5 6 7 8 13 14 18 19 22 23 30 31 38 39 40 41 49 49 50
i would recommend to any one lloking for a first class computer !
0 1 2 7 8 17 18 20 21 24 25 28 29 36 37 40 41 42 43 48 49 54 55 63 63 64
i do not like too much windows 8 .
0 1 2 4 5 8 9 13 14 17 18 22 23 30 31 32 32 33
startup times are incredibly long : over two minutes .
0 7 8 13 14 17 18 28 29 33 33 34 35 39 40 43 44 51 51 52
i bought this macbook pro from best buy under a year ago to replace my old macbook air .
0 1 2 8 9 13 14 21 22 25 26 30 31 35 36 39 40 45 46 47 48 52 53 56 57 59 60 67 68 70 71 74 75 82 83 86 86 87
the macbook pro is really responsive .
0 3 4 11 12 15 16 18 19 25 26 36 36 37
also stunning colors and speedy
0 4 5 13 14 20 21 24 25 31
it is really expensive though .
0 2 3 5 6 12 13 22 23 29 29 30
great price free shipping what else can i ask for !!
0 5 6 11 12 16 17 25 26 30 31 35 36 39 40 41 42 45 46 49 49 51
this mouse is terrific .
0 4 5 10 11 13 14 22 22 23
i will also say it is much better than i expected !
0 1 2 6 7 11 12 15 16 18 19 21 22 26 27 33 34 38 39 40 41 49 49 50
this computer does everything i need it to do for school and more .
0 4 5 13 14 18 19 29 30 31 32 36 37 39 40 42 43 45 46 49 50 56 57 60 61 65 65 66
it is really thick around the battery .
0 2 3 5 6 12 13 18 19 25 26 29 30 37 37 38
and windows 7 works like a charm .
0 3 4 11 12 13 14 19 20 24 25 26 27 32 32 33
and i can attach my projector to it .
0 3 4 5 6 9 10 16 17 19 20 29 30 32 33 35 35 36
:-rrb- great product , great price , great delivery , and great service .
0 2 3 8 9 16 16 17 18 23 24 29 29 30 31 36 37 45 45 46 47 50 51 56 57 64 64 65
:] it arrived so fast and customer service was great .
0 2 3 5 6 13 14 16 17 21 22 25 26 34 35 42 43 46 47 52 52 53
tried windows 8 and hated it !!!
0 5 6 13 14 15 16 19 20 25 26 28 29 32
the price is higher than most lab top out there ; however , he/she will get what they paid for , which is a great computer .
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 19 20 24 25 29 30 33 34 37 38 41 42 47 47 48 49 56 56 57 58 64 65 69 70 73 74 78 79 83 84 88 89 92 92 93 94 99 100 102 103 104 105 110 111 119 119 120
so , i thought why not give mac book pro a try .
0 2 2 3 4 5 6 13 14 17 18 21 22 26 27 30 31 35 36 39 40 41 42 45 45 46
set up was a breeze .
0 3 4 6 7 10 11 12 13 19 19 20
but i do not like win8 .
0 3 4 5 6 8 9 12 13 17 18 22 22 23
i have owned at least 4 to 5 laptops and computers - but this is by far the most superior machine i have ever owned .
0 1 2 6 7 12 13 15 16 21 22 23 24 26 27 28 29 36 37 40 41 50 51 52 53 56 57 61 62 64 65 67 68 71 72 75 76 80 81 89 90 97 98 99 100 104 105 109 110 115 115 116
i am still in the process of learning about its features .
0 1 2 4 5 10 11 13 14 17 18 25 26 28 29 37 38 43 44 47 48 56 56 57
btw , i checked online regarding the old laptop that ` died ' and found that i was not alone , far from it .
0 3 3 4 5 6 7 14 15 21 22 31 32 35 36 39 40 46 47 51 52 53 53 57 57 58 59 62 63 68 69 73 74 75 76 79 80 83 84 89 89 90 91 94 95 99 100 102 102 103
i had the same reasons as most pc users : the price , the overbearing restrictions of osx and lack of support for games .
0 1 2 5 6 9 10 14 15 22 23 25 26 30 31 33 34 39 39 40 41 44 45 50 50 51 52 55 56 67 68 80 81 83 84 87 88 91 92 96 97 99 100 107 108 111 112 117 117 118
i wanted it for it 's mobility and man , this little bad boy is very nice .
0 1 2 8 9 11 12 15 16 18 18 20 21 29 30 33 34 37 37 38 39 43 44 50 51 54 55 58 59 61 62 66 67 71 71 72
seems to me that 's the best way to get apple 's attention .
0 5 6 8 9 11 12 16 16 18 19 22 23 27 28 31 32 34 35 38 39 44 44 46 47 56 56 57
very nice so far .
0 4 5 9 10 12 13 16 16 17
you wo n't be disappointed .
0 3 4 6 6 9 10 12 13 25 25 26
the investment of a new macbook pro came at a price , but totally worth it for a good piece of mind .
0 3 4 14 15 17 18 19 20 23 24 31 32 35 36 40 41 43 44 45 46 51 51 52 53 56 57 64 65 70 71 73 74 77 78 79 80 84 85 90 91 93 94 98 98 99
i found the mini to be : exceptionally easy to set up
0 1 2 7 8 11 12 16 17 19 20 22 22 23 23 36 37 41 42 44 45 48 49 51
having usb3 is why i bought this mini .
0 6 7 11 12 14 15 18 19 20 21 27 28 32 33 37 37 38
be sure to have good air flow where ever you put it .

the sound is nice and loud ; i do n't have any problems with hearing anything .
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 17 18 21 22 26 26 27 28 29 30 32 32 35 36 40 41 44 45 53 54 58 59 66 67 75 75 76
it is very slim , the track pad is very much impressed with me .
0 2 3 5 6 10 11 15 15 16 17 20 21 26 27 30 31 33 34 38 39 43 44 53 54 58 59 61 61 62
this was the same problem with my macbook -lrb- circa 2007 -rrb- that i just retired .
0 4 5 8 9 12 13 17 18 25 26 30 31 33 34 41 42 43 43 48 49 53 53 54 55 59 60 61 62 66 67 74 74 75
great things come in small `` packages .

huge apple mac fan !
0 4 5 10 11 14 15 18 18 19
looked at hp , asus , acer , sony and a bunch of other ones but could not find i really liked .
0 6 7 9 10 12 12 13 14 18 18 19 20 24 24 25 26 30 31 34 35 36 37 42 43 45 46 51 52 56 57 60 61 66 67 70 71 75 76 77 78 84 85 90 90 91
the settings are not user-friendly either .
0 3 4 12 13 16 17 20 21 34 35 41 41 42
honestly , i am surprised no one else has mentioned returning theirs .
0 8 8 9 10 11 12 14 15 24 25 27 28 31 32 36 37 40 41 50 51 60 61 67 67 68
most of them were either too big , too noisy and too slow after 2 years .
0 4 5 7 8 12 13 17 18 24 25 28 29 32 32 33 34 37 38 43 44 47 48 51 52 56 57 62 63 64 65 70 70 71
the machine is used , but is like new , i 'm very impress .
0 3 4 11 12 14 15 19 19 20 21 24 25 27 28 32 33 36 36 37 38 39 39 41 42 46 47 54 54 55
thank goodness for openoffice !
0 5 6 14 15 18 19 29 29 30
awesome form factor , great battery life , wonderful ux .
0 7 8 12 13 19 19 20 21 26 27 34 35 39 39 40 41 50 51 53 53 54
needless to say , the leap from that to this has been amazing and -lrb- aside from the financial reasons -rrb- i am astounded that i had n't made the switch sooner .
0 8 9 11 12 15 15 16 17 20 21 25 26 30 31 35 36 38 39 43 44 47 48 52 53 60 61 64 65 66 66 71 72 76 77 80 81 90 91 98 98 99 100 101 102 104 105 114 115 119 120 121 122 125 125 128 129 133 134 137 138 144 145 151 151 152
its perfect , not much heavy .
0 3 4 11 11 12 13 16 17 21 22 27 27 28
i love the keyboard and the screen .
0 1 2 6 7 10 11 19 20 23 24 27 28 34 34 35
i find it not to be very user friendly .
0 1 2 6 7 9 10 13 14 16 17 19 20 24 25 29 30 38 38 39
it has surpassed all expectations and fulfilled all my needs .
0 2 3 6 7 16 17 20 21 33 34 37 38 47 48 51 52 54 55 60 60 61
however , there are major issues with the touchpad which render the device nearly useless .
0 7 7 8 9 14 15 18 19 24 25 31 32 36 37 40 41 49 50 55 56 62 63 66 67 73 74 80 81 88 88 89
what angers me more than anything else is that i spent all those years hating macs when i could have been getting a lot more production with a whole lot less grief !
0 4 5 11 12 14 15 19 20 24 25 33 34 38 39 41 42 46 47 48 49 54 55 58 59 64 65 70 71 77 78 82 83 87 88 89 90 95 96 100 101 105 106 113 114 115 116 119 120 124 125 135 136 140 141 142 143 148 149 152 153 157 158 163 163 164
i 've already upgraded o mavericks and i am impressed with everything about this computer .
0 1 1 4 5 12 13 21 22 23 24 33 34 37 38 39 40 42 43 52 53 57 58 68 69 74 75 79 80 88 88 89
so this is very good commputer and i highly suggest it .
0 2 3 7 8 10 11 15 16 20 21 30 31 34 35 36 37 43 44 51 52 54 54 55
the mbp i recieved was everything it should have been .
0 3 4 7 8 9 10 18 19 22 23 33 34 36 37 43 44 48 49 53 53 54
i was going to buy today and noticed it went back up to $ 344.99 ?
0 1 2 5 6 11 12 14 15 18 19 24 25 28 29 36 37 39 40 44 45 49 50 52 53 55 56 57 57 63 63 64
not as fast as i would have expect for an i5 .
0 3 4 6 7 11 12 14 15 16 17 22 23 27 28 34 35 38 39 41 42 44 44 45
so of course this one came through with the awesomeness !
0 2 3 5 6 12 13 17 18 21 22 26 27 34 35 39 40 43 44 55 55 56
you will not regret buying this computer !
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 19 20 26 27 31 32 40 40 41
nothing bad to say about it .
0 7 8 11 12 14 15 18 19 24 25 27 27 28
it s heavy for mac book but is good .
0 2 3 4 5 10 11 14 15 18 19 23 24 27 28 30 31 35 35 36
thanks for great service and shipping !
0 6 7 10 11 16 17 24 25 28 29 37 37 38
deal of the year .
0 4 5 7 8 11 12 16 16 17
my sisters same laptop broke about the month later for the same reason .
0 2 3 10 11 15 16 22 23 28 29 34 35 38 39 44 45 50 51 54 55 58 59 63 64 70 70 71
minis make sense for a lot of people .
0 5 6 10 11 16 17 20 21 22 23 26 27 29 30 36 36 37
the performance seems quite good , and built-in applications like iphoto work great with my phone and camera .
0 3 4 15 16 21 22 27 28 32 32 33 34 37 38 46 47 59 60 64 65 71 72 76 77 82 83 87 88 90 91 96 97 100 101 107 107 108
this mac mini makes the macbook pro seem slow .
0 4 5 8 9 13 14 19 20 23 24 31 32 35 36 40 41 45 45 46
i did swap out the hard drive for a samsung 830 ssd which i highly recommend .
0 1 2 5 6 10 11 14 15 18 19 23 24 29 30 33 34 35 36 43 44 47 48 51 52 57 58 59 60 66 67 76 76 77
i bought this macbook pro to replace my six-year-old pc -lrb- a sony vaio -rrb- , but it was basically no better than my old pc , so i returned it .
0 1 2 8 9 13 14 21 22 25 26 28 29 36 37 39 40 52 53 55 56 57 57 58 59 63 64 68 68 69 69 70 71 74 75 77 78 81 82 91 92 94 95 101 102 106 107 109 110 113 114 116 116 117 118 120 121 122 123 131 132 134 134 135
i wanted a simple , reliable laptop .
0 1 2 8 9 10 11 17 17 18 19 27 29 35 35 36
cheaper than buying it @ apple too !
0 7 8 12 13 19 20 22 23 24 25 30 31 34 34 35
i have just had to learn to be a little harder typer than on my last computer .
0 1 2 6 7 11 12 15 16 18 19 24 25 27 28 30 31 32 33 39 40 46 47 52 53 57 58 60 61 63 64 68 69 77 77 78
extremely disappointed with the way it is .
0 9 10 22 23 27 28 31 32 35 36 38 39 41 41 42
never been happier using computer .
0 5 6 10 11 18 19 24 26 34 34 35
i have had a total of 5 different laptop from many different manufactures .
0 1 2 6 7 10 11 12 13 18 19 21 22 23 24 33 34 40 41 45 46 50 51 60 61 73 73 74
does everything i wanted this laptop to do .
0 4 5 15 16 17 18 24 25 29 30 36 37 39 40 42 42 43
besides , the apple stocks have been falling due to lack of sales .
0 7 7 8 9 12 13 18 19 25 26 30 31 35 36 43 44 47 48 50 51 55 56 58 59 64 64 65
turns out this is a common problem .
0 5 6 9 10 14 15 17 18 19 20 26 27 34 34 35
starts up in a hurry and everything is ready to go .
0 6 7 9 10 12 13 14 15 20 21 24 25 35 36 38 39 44 45 47 48 50 50 51
it is also fast as can be ... you get what you pay for ... well worth the investment
0 2 3 5 6 10 11 15 16 18 19 22 23 25 25 28 29 32 33 36 37 41 42 45 46 49 50 53 53 56 57 61 62 67 68 71 72 82
but i 'm still learning so ca n't rate it yet for everything .
0 3 4 5 5 7 8 13 14 22 23 25 26 28 28 31 32 36 37 39 40 43 44 47 48 58 58 59
overall very impressed , thank you apple and amazon !
0 7 8 12 13 22 22 23 24 29 30 33 34 39 40 43 44 50 50 51
yes , that 's a good thing , but it 's made from aluminum that scratches easily .
0 3 3 4 5 9 9 11 12 13 14 18 19 24 24 25 26 29 30 32 32 34 35 39 40 44 45 53 54 58 59 68 69 75 75 76
very fast for my needs .
0 4 5 9 10 13 14 16 17 22 22 23
i bought this mac in order to replace my old dell laptop .
0 1 2 8 9 13 14 17 18 20 21 26 27 29 30 37 38 40 41 44 45 49 50 56 56 57
quick and has built in virus control .
0 5 6 9 10 13 14 19 20 22 23 28 29 36 36 37
took a long time trying to decide between one with retina display and one without .
0 4 5 6 7 11 12 16 17 23 24 26 27 33 34 41 42 45 46 50 51 57 58 65 66 69 70 73 74 81 81 82
i saw the mini mac at best buy and decided to get this as my replacement .
0 1 2 5 6 9 10 14 15 18 19 21 22 26 27 30 31 34 35 42 43 45 46 49 50 54 55 57 58 60 61 72 72 73
i finally decided on this one and could n't be any happier .
0 1 2 9 10 17 18 20 21 25 26 29 30 33 34 39 39 42 43 45 46 49 50 57 57 58
i was also informed that the components of the mac book were dirty .
0 1 2 5 6 10 11 19 20 24 25 28 29 39 40 42 43 46 47 50 51 55 56 60 61 66 66 67
so glad i did not waste money on a less than par product .
0 2 3 7 8 9 10 13 14 17 18 23 24 29 30 32 33 34 35 39 40 44 45 48 49 56 56 57
have n't regretted it one bit .
0 4 4 7 8 17 18 20 21 24 25 28 28 29
the one thing that apple does right is computers .
0 3 4 7 8 13 14 18 19 24 25 29 30 35 36 38 39 48 48 49
the hardware problems have been so bad , i ca n't wait till it completely dies in 3 years , tops !
0 3 4 12 13 21 22 26 27 31 32 34 35 38 38 39 40 41 42 44 44 47 48 52 53 57 58 60 61 71 72 76 77 79 80 81 82 87 87 88 89 93 93 94
it 's so nice that the battery last so long and that this machine has the snow lion !
0 2 2 4 5 7 8 12 13 17 18 21 22 29 30 34 35 37 38 42 43 46 47 51 52 56 57 64 65 68 69 72 73 77 78 82 82 83
i think that they are the best out on the market .
0 1 2 7 8 12 13 17 18 21 22 25 26 30 31 34 35 37 38 41 42 48 48 49
however i chose two day shipping and it took over a week to arrive .
0 7 8 9 10 15 16 19 20 23 24 32 33 36 37 39 40 44 45 49 50 51 52 56 57 59 60 66 66 67
that 's quite a bump up from the $ 599 that this little guy sells for , which leaves me to my next point .
0 4 4 6 7 12 13 14 15 19 20 22 23 27 28 31 32 33 33 36 37 41 42 46 47 53 54 57 58 63 64 67 67 68 69 74 75 81 82 84 85 87 88 90 91 95 96 101 101 102
this is quite smooth as well as heavy and can easily slip through the hands .
0 4 5 7 8 13 14 20 21 23 24 28 29 31 32 37 38 41 42 45 46 52 53 57 58 65 66 69 70 75 75 76
my laptop is so light that i can take it with me anywhere .
0 2 3 9 10 12 13 15 16 21 22 26 27 28 29 32 33 37 38 40 41 45 46 48 49 57 57 58
it 's exactly what i wanted , and it has all the new features and whatnot .
0 2 2 4 5 12 13 17 18 19 20 26 26 27 28 31 32 34 35 38 39 42 43 46 47 50 51 59 60 63 64 71 71 72
you can do absolutely anything and is very fast and stylish .
0 3 4 7 8 10 11 21 22 30 31 34 35 37 38 42 43 47 48 51 52 59 59 60
finally decided to try a mac because there were too many choices of which pc 's to buy and everyone who had a mac said `` buy a mac '' .
0 7 8 15 16 18 19 22 23 24 25 28 29 36 37 42 43 47 48 51 52 56 57 64 65 67 68 73 74 76 76 78 79 81 82 85 86 89 90 98 99 102 103 106 107 108 109 112 113 117 118 119 119 122 123 124 125 128 128 129 129 130
can you buy any laptop that matches the quality of a macbook ?
0 3 4 7 8 11 12 15 16 22 23 27 28 35 36 39 40 47 48 50 51 52 53 60 60 61
it feels cheap , the keyboard is not very sensitive .
0 2 3 8 9 14 14 15 16 19 20 28 29 31 32 35 36 40 41 50 50 51
that defeated the whole point of a laptop .
0 4 5 13 14 17 18 23 24 29 30 32 33 34 35 41 41 42
though please note that sometimes it crashes , and the sound quality isnt superb .
0 6 7 13 14 18 19 23 24 33 34 36 37 44 44 45 46 49 50 53 54 59 60 67 68 72 73 79 79 80
it is very easy to navigate even for a novice .
0 2 3 5 6 10 11 15 16 18 19 27 28 32 33 36 37 38 39 45 45 46
but until now , no complains at all .
0 3 4 9 10 13 13 14 15 17 18 27 28 30 31 34 34 35
the cons are more annoyances that can be lived with .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 17 18 28 29 33 34 37 38 40 41 46 47 51 51 52
does everything i need it to , has a wonderful battery life and i could n't be happier .
0 4 5 15 16 17 18 22 23 25 26 28 28 29 30 33 34 35 36 45 46 53 54 58 59 62 63 64 65 70 70 73 74 76 77 84 84 85
great performance and quality .
0 5 6 17 18 21 22 29 29 30
just what i needed for portable and my wallet too !
0 4 5 9 10 11 12 18 19 22 23 31 32 35 36 38 39 45 46 49 49 50
the device speaks about it self .
0 3 4 10 11 17 18 23 24 26 27 31 31 32
i used windows xp , windows vista , and windows 7 extensively .
0 1 2 6 7 14 15 17 17 18 19 26 27 32 32 33 34 37 38 45 46 47 48 59 59 60
the only thing that bums me out about this purchase is they released a newer updated mbp seriously right after i bought this one .

it does get hot when using on a bed or sofa and gets warm on a desk ... this is in an un-air conditioned room ... in air condition it gets slightly warm ...

i had my pc laptop for 3 years and going to a macbook pro is like i leaped through time .
0 1 2 5 6 8 9 11 12 18 19 22 23 24 25 30 31 34 35 40 41 43 44 45 46 53 54 57 58 60 61 65 66 67 68 74 75 82 83 87 87 88
on start up it asks endless questions just so itune can sell you more of their products .
0 2 3 8 9 11 12 14 15 19 20 27 28 37 38 42 43 45 46 51 52 55 56 60 61 64 65 69 70 72 73 78 79 87 87 88
pretty much made sense to get a mini .
0 6 7 11 12 16 17 22 23 25 26 29 30 31 32 36 36 37
i have been a pc user for a very long time now but i will get used to this new os .
0 1 2 6 7 11 12 13 14 16 17 21 22 25 26 27 28 32 33 37 38 42 43 46 47 50 51 52 53 57 58 61 62 66 67 69 70 74 75 78 79 81 81 82
not something you want to miss out on !!!
0 3 4 13 14 17 18 22 23 25 26 30 31 34 35 37 37 40
one more thing , this mac does not come with restore disks and i am not sure if you can make them direct from the mac like you can with newer pc 's , also the charging cables are made of the same cheap material as the iphone/ipod touch cables .
0 3 4 8 9 14 14 15 16 20 21 24 25 29 30 33 34 38 39 43 44 51 52 57 58 61 62 63 64 66 67 70 71 75 76 78 79 82 83 86 87 91 92 96 97 103 104 108 109 112 113 116 117 121 122 125 126 129 130 134 135 140 141 143 143 145 145 146 147 151 152 155 156 164 165 171 172 175 176 180 181 183 184 187 188 192 193 198 199 207 208 210 211 214 215 226 227 232 233 239 239 240
i bought it to my son who uses it for graphic design .
0 1 2 8 9 11 12 14 15 17 18 21 22 25 26 30 31 33 34 37 38 45 46 52 52 53
i previously owned an older dell laptop that died after about 5 or 6 years .
0 1 2 12 13 18 19 21 22 27 28 32 33 39 40 44 45 49 50 55 56 61 62 63 64 66 67 68 69 74 74 75
its a pretty decent computer .
0 3 4 5 6 12 13 19 20 28 28 29
i never tried any external mics with that imac .
0 1 2 7 8 13 14 17 18 26 27 31 32 36 37 41 42 46 46 47
the new os is great on my macbook pro !
0 3 4 7 8 10 11 13 14 19 20 22 23 25 26 33 34 37 37 38
it was fast , and it was `` different '' .
0 2 3 6 7 11 11 12 13 16 17 19 20 23 24 25 25 34 34 35 35 36
i had a little problem adjusting to the small screen but works fine as long as i remember to carry my glasses .
0 1 2 5 6 7 8 14 15 22 23 32 33 35 36 39 40 45 46 52 53 56 57 62 63 67 68 70 71 75 76 78 79 80 81 89 90 92 93 98 99 101 102 109 109 110
i purchased my first mac and am glad i did .
0 1 2 11 12 14 15 20 21 24 25 28 29 31 32 36 37 38 39 42 42 43
i have experienced no problems , works as anticipated .
0 1 2 6 7 18 19 21 22 30 30 31 32 37 38 40 41 52 52 53
system is running great .
0 6 7 9 10 17 18 23 23 24
easy to customize setting and even create your own bookmarks .
0 4 5 7 8 17 18 25 26 29 30 34 35 41 42 46 47 50 51 60 60 61
they really screwed the pooch on this one .
0 4 5 11 12 19 20 23 24 29 30 32 33 37 38 41 41 42
the mac mini , wireless keyboard / mouse and a hdmi cable is all i need to get some real work done .
0 3 4 7 8 12 12 13 14 22 23 31 32 33 34 39 40 43 44 45 46 50 51 56 57 59 60 63 64 65 66 70 71 73 74 77 78 82 83 87 88 92 93 97 97 98
i finally pulled the trigger and i am blown away by how much more i enjoy my computer tasks using the mac mini !!!
0 1 2 9 10 16 17 20 21 28 29 32 33 34 35 37 38 43 44 48 49 51 52 55 56 60 61 65 66 67 68 73 74 76 77 85 86 91 92 97 98 101 102 105 106 110 110 113
it has all the features that we expected and the price was good , working well so far .
0 2 3 6 7 10 11 14 15 23 24 28 29 31 32 40 41 44 45 48 49 54 55 58 59 63 63 64 65 72 73 77 78 80 81 84 84 85
i work as a designer and coder and i needed a new buddy to work with , not gaming .
0 1 2 6 7 9 10 11 12 20 21 24 25 30 31 34 35 36 37 43 44 45 46 49 50 55 56 58 59 63 64 68 68 69 70 73 74 80 80 81
i was told that it seems to be a multi - component failure .
0 1 2 5 6 10 11 15 16 18 19 24 25 27 28 30 31 32 33 38 39 40 41 50 51 58 58 59
the new operating system makes this computer into a super ipad .
0 3 4 7 8 17 18 24 25 30 31 35 36 44 45 49 50 51 52 57 58 62 62 63
i am very happy with my first mac .
0 1 2 4 5 9 10 15 16 20 21 23 24 29 30 33 33 34
easy to set up and go !
0 4 5 7 8 11 12 14 15 18 19 21 21 22
i ca n't believe how quiet the hard drive is and how quick this thing boots up .
0 1 2 4 4 7 8 15 16 19 20 25 26 29 30 34 35 40 41 43 44 47 48 51 52 57 58 62 63 68 69 74 75 77 77 78
the only issue came when i tried scanning to the mac .
0 3 4 8 9 14 15 19 20 24 25 26 27 32 33 41 42 44 45 48 49 52 52 53
the machine is speedy and efficient .
0 3 4 11 12 14 15 21 22 25 26 35 35 36
i think this is about as good as it gets at anything close to this price point .
0 1 2 7 8 12 13 15 16 21 22 24 25 29 30 32 33 35 36 40 41 43 44 52 53 58 59 61 62 66 67 72 73 78 78 79
a * big * upgrade from my 13 '' 2006 macbook .
0 1 2 3 3 6 6 7 8 15 16 20 21 23 24 26 26 27 28 32 33 40 40 41
it 's just what we were looking for and it works great .
0 2 2 4 5 9 10 14 15 17 18 22 23 30 31 34 35 38 39 41 42 47 48 53 53 54
having a mac certainly makes life easier .
0 6 7 8 9 12 13 22 23 28 29 33 34 40 40 41
it 's so quick and responsive that it makes working/surfing on a computer so much more pleasurable !
0 2 2 4 5 7 8 13 14 17 18 28 29 33 34 36 37 42 43 58 59 61 62 63 64 72 73 75 76 80 81 85 86 97 97 98
the old unibody macbook pro could fry an egg after a while .
0 3 4 7 8 15 16 23 24 27 28 33 34 37 38 40 41 44 45 50 51 52 53 58 58 59
it works fine , and all the software seems to run pretty well .
0 2 3 8 9 13 13 14 15 18 19 22 23 26 27 35 36 41 42 44 45 48 49 55 56 60 60 61
for this purpose , it 's great .
0 3 4 8 9 16 16 17 18 20 20 22 23 28 28 29
could n't have asked for more !
0 5 5 8 9 13 14 19 20 23 24 28 28 29
i 'm using this computer for word processing , web browsing , some gaming , and i 'm learning programming .
0 1 1 3 4 9 10 14 15 23 24 27 28 32 33 43 43 44 45 48 49 57 57 58 59 63 64 70 70 71 72 75 76 77 77 79 80 88 89 100 100 101
it certainly does , but you rarely hear any of your friends with mac 's complain about anything .
0 2 3 12 13 17 17 18 19 22 23 26 27 33 34 38 39 42 43 45 46 50 51 58 59 63 64 67 67 69 70 78 79 84 85 93 93 94
my wife was so excited to open the box , but quickly came to see that it did not function as it should .
0 2 3 7 8 11 12 14 15 22 23 25 26 30 31 34 35 38 38 39 40 43 44 51 52 56 57 59 60 63 64 68 69 71 72 75 76 79 80 88 89 91 92 94 95 101 101 102
i do n't have any technical pearls to share .
0 1 2 4 4 7 8 12 13 16 17 26 27 33 34 36 37 42 42 43
i wanted a computer that was quite , fast , and that had overall great performance .
0 1 2 8 9 10 11 19 20 24 25 28 29 34 34 35 36 40 40 41 42 45 46 50 51 54 55 62 63 68 69 80 80 81
apple `` help '' is a mixed bag .
0 5 6 7 7 11 11 12 13 15 16 17 18 23 24 27 27 28
all i can say is i am impressed .
0 3 4 5 6 9 10 13 14 16 17 18 19 21 22 31 31 32
it suddenly can not work .
0 2 3 11 12 15 16 19 20 24 24 25
it did everything we expected !
0 2 3 6 7 17 18 20 21 29 29 30
harddrive was in poor condition , had to replace it .
0 9 10 13 14 16 17 21 22 31 31 32 33 36 37 39 40 47 48 50 50 51
the on/off switch is a bit obscure in the rear corner .
0 3 4 10 11 17 18 20 21 22 23 26 27 34 35 37 38 41 42 46 47 53 53 54
it 's a nice little gadget .
0 2 2 4 5 6 7 11 12 18 19 25 25 26
my only complaint is the total lack of instructions that come with the mac mini .
0 2 3 7 8 17 18 20 21 24 25 30 31 35 36 38 39 51 52 56 57 61 62 66 67 70 71 74 75 79 79 80
the only task that this computer would not be good enough for would be gaming , otherwise the integrated intel 4000 graphics work well for other tasks .
0 3 4 8 9 13 14 18 19 23 24 32 33 38 39 42 43 45 46 50 51 57 58 61 62 67 68 70 71 77 77 78 79 88 89 92 93 103 104 109 110 114 115 123 124 128 129 133 134 137 138 143 144 149 149 150
it 's macbook pro and there is no discusion about it .
0 2 2 4 5 12 13 16 17 20 21 26 27 29 30 32 33 42 43 48 49 51 51 52
i 'm hoping the rest of the features will be the signature quality of apple .
0 1 1 3 4 10 11 14 15 19 20 22 23 26 27 35 36 40 41 43 44 47 48 57 58 65 66 68 69 74 74 75
i use it mostly for content creation -lrb- audio , video , photo editing -rrb- and its reliable .
0 1 2 5 6 8 9 15 16 19 20 27 28 36 37 38 38 43 43 44 45 50 50 51 52 57 58 65 65 66 67 70 71 74 75 83 83 84
it is the best all around mac .
0 2 3 5 6 9 10 14 15 18 19 25 26 29 29 30
screen is bright and gorgeous .
0 6 7 9 10 16 17 20 21 29 29 30
also is portable and reliable .
0 4 5 7 8 16 17 20 21 29 29 30
the only solution is to turn the brightness down , etc. .
0 3 4 8 9 17 18 20 21 23 24 28 29 32 33 43 44 48 48 49 50 53 53 54
it is not an easy decision to purchase a used or even good as new laptop but i am very satisfied .
0 2 3 5 6 9 10 12 13 17 18 26 27 29 30 38 39 40 41 45 46 48 49 53 54 58 59 61 62 65 66 72 73 76 77 78 79 81 82 86 87 96 96 97
if you want more information on macs i suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications .
0 2 3 6 7 11 12 16 17 28 29 31 32 36 37 38 39 46 47 52 53 55 56 65 66 69 70 77 78 85 86 89 90 97 98 102 103 106 107 111 112 123 124 126 127 130 131 143 143 144
it is robust , with a friendly use as all apple products .
0 2 3 5 6 12 12 13 14 18 19 20 21 29 30 33 34 36 37 40 41 46 47 55 55 56
even if you do n't do business , thats okay , it 's incredibly fast .
0 4 5 7 8 11 12 14 14 17 18 20 21 29 29 30 31 36 37 41 41 42 43 45 45 47 48 58 59 63 63 64
it is fast and easy to use .
0 2 3 5 6 10 11 14 15 19 20 22 23 26 26 27
this was absolutely annoying !
0 4 5 8 9 19 20 28 28 29
and the fact that it comes with an i5 processor definitely speeds things up
0 3 4 7 8 12 13 17 18 20 21 26 27 31 32 34 35 37 38 47 48 58 59 65 66 72 73 75
but for those of you that dont have a mac and are still on the pc 's this is a good foot in the door into mac .
0 3 4 7 8 13 14 16 17 20 21 25 26 30 31 35 36 37 38 41 42 45 46 49 50 55 56 58 59 62 63 65 65 67 68 72 73 75 76 77 78 82 83 87 88 90 91 94 95 99 100 104 105 108 108 109
i have been pc for years but this computer is intuitive and its built in features are a great help
0 1 2 6 7 11 12 14 15 18 19 24 25 28 29 33 34 42 43 45 46 55 56 59 60 63 64 69 70 72 73 81 82 85 86 87 88 93 94 98
and it fits in my briefcase with ease
0 3 4 6 7 11 12 14 15 17 18 27 28 32 33 37
nice screen , keyboard works great !
0 4 5 11 11 12 13 21 22 27 28 33 33 34
still not bad for 220.00 .
0 5 6 9 10 13 14 17 18 24 24 25
i was amazed at how fast the delivery was .
0 1 2 5 6 12 13 15 16 19 20 24 25 28 29 37 38 41 41 42
good computer and fast .
0 4 5 13 14 17 18 22 22 23
i 've installed to it additional ssd and 16gb ram .
0 1 1 4 5 14 15 17 18 20 21 31 32 35 36 39 40 44 45 48 48 49
the memory was gone and it was not able to be used .
0 3 4 10 11 14 15 19 20 23 24 26 27 30 31 34 35 39 40 42 43 45 46 50 50 51
its pretty much fire it up and go .
0 3 4 10 11 15 16 20 21 23 24 26 27 30 31 33 33 34
it works great and i am so happy i bought it .
0 2 3 8 9 14 15 18 19 20 21 23 24 26 27 32 33 34 35 41 42 44 44 45
let me start off by saying that i was highly reluctant to spend so much money on a laptop .

apple is living up to its name with the mini and , for our needs , it 's perfect .

i went from a macbook to this mac mini and this was a great upgrade !
0 1 2 6 7 11 12 13 14 21 22 24 25 29 30 33 34 38 39 42 43 47 48 51 52 53 54 59 60 67 67 68
web browsing is very quick with safari browser .
0 3 4 12 13 15 16 20 21 26 27 31 32 38 39 46 46 47
it could n't have been a better decision .
0 2 3 8 8 11 12 16 17 21 22 23 24 30 31 39 39 40
i like the lighted screen at night .
0 1 2 6 7 10 11 18 19 25 26 28 29 34 34 35
it 's great to have a solid mac in the living room .
0 2 2 4 5 10 11 13 14 18 19 20 21 26 27 30 31 33 34 37 38 44 45 49 49 50
it is really easy to use and it is quick to start up .
0 2 3 5 6 12 13 17 18 20 21 24 25 28 29 31 32 34 35 40 41 43 44 49 50 52 52 53
i 've lived with the crashes and slow operation and restarts .
0 1 1 4 5 10 11 15 16 19 20 27 28 31 32 36 37 46 47 50 51 59 59 60
very light and easily maneuverable .
0 4 5 10 11 14 15 21 22 34 34 35
usb3 peripherals are noticably less expensive than the thunderbolt ones .
0 4 5 16 17 20 21 30 31 35 36 45 46 50 51 54 55 66 67 71 71 72
this can be annoying at first but you just have to train yourself not to to start over so far .
0 4 5 8 9 11 12 20 21 23 24 29 30 33 34 37 38 42 43 47 48 50 51 56 57 65 66 69 70 72 73 75 76 81 82 86 87 89 90 93 93 94
and mine had broke but i sent it in under warranty-no problems .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 18 19 22 23 24 25 29 30 32 33 35 36 41 42 53 54 62 62 63
i am not happy with my purchase
0 1 2 4 5 8 9 14 15 19 20 22 23 31
it 's fast , light , and is perfect for media editing , which is mostly why i bought it in the first place .
0 2 2 4 5 9 9 10 11 16 16 17 18 21 22 24 25 32 33 36 37 42 43 50 50 51 52 57 58 60 61 67 68 71 72 73 74 80 81 83 84 86 87 90 91 96 97 102 102 103
however , the machine itself left a bit to be desired .
0 7 7 8 9 12 13 20 21 27 28 32 33 34 35 38 39 41 42 44 45 52 52 53
the battery lasts as advertised -lrb- give or take 15-20 minutes -rrb- , and the entire user experience is very elegant .
0 3 4 11 12 17 18 20 21 31 32 33 33 37 38 40 41 45 46 51 52 59 59 60 60 61 62 65 66 69 70 76 77 81 82 92 93 95 96 100 101 108 108 109

0 1 1 9 10 21 21 22 23 32 32 33 34 46 47 50 51 55 56 64 64 65
the smaller size was a bonus because of space restrictions .
0 3 4 11 12 16 17 20 21 22 23 28 29 36 37 39 40 45 46 58 58 59
i blame the mac os .
0 1 2 7 8 11 12 15 16 18 18 19
but for now , this laptop is still a workhorse .
0 3 4 7 8 11 11 12 13 17 18 24 25 27 28 33 34 35 36 45 45 46
in fact i still use manylegacy programs -lrb- appleworks , filemaker pro , quicken , photoshop etc -rrb- !
0 2 3 7 8 9 10 15 16 19 20 30 31 39 40 41 41 51 51 52 53 62 63 66 66 67 68 75 75 76 77 86 87 90 90 91 91 92
it 's small but powerful , light but strong , elegant and beautiful ... in resume : it 's a mac !
0 2 2 4 5 10 11 14 15 23 23 24 25 30 31 34 35 41 41 42 43 50 51 54 55 64 64 67 68 70 71 77 77 78 79 81 81 83 84 85 86 89 89 90
i like the operating system .
0 1 2 6 7 10 11 20 21 27 27 28
i wish i would have taken the plunge years ago .
0 1 2 6 7 8 9 14 15 19 20 25 26 29 30 36 37 42 43 46 46 47
i love the form factor .
0 1 2 6 7 10 11 15 16 22 22 23
i have n't used the product long enough to write a detailed technical review .
0 1 2 6 6 9 10 14 15 18 19 26 27 31 32 38 39 41 42 47 48 49 50 58 59 68 69 75 75 76
it 's fast at loading the internet .
0 2 2 4 5 9 10 12 13 20 21 24 25 33 33 34
so much faster and sleeker looking .
0 2 3 7 8 14 15 18 19 26 27 34 34 35
i plan on using my macbook pro for a long time .
0 1 2 6 7 9 10 15 16 18 19 26 27 30 31 34 35 36 37 41 42 46 46 47
unfortunately , it runs xp and microsoft is dropping support next april .
0 13 13 14 15 17 18 22 23 25 26 29 30 39 40 42 43 51 52 59 60 64 65 70 70 71
its seen in movies , sitcoms , prominent important people carry and use them and they are great !
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 18 18 19 20 27 27 28 29 38 39 48 49 55 56 61 62 65 66 69 70 74 75 78 79 83 84 87 88 93 93 94
first off , i really do like my mbp ... once used to the os it is pretty easy to get around , and the overall build is great ... eg the keyboard is one of the best to type on .
0 5 6 9 9 10 11 12 13 19 20 22 23 27 28 30 31 34 34 37 38 42 43 47 48 50 51 54 55 57 58 60 61 63 64 70 71 75 76 78 79 82 83 89 89 90 91 94 95 98 99 106 107 112 113 115 116 121 121 124 125 127 128 131 132 140 141 143 144 147 148 150 151 154 155 159 160 162 163 167 168 170 170 171

0 3 4 7 8 11 12 16 17 19 19 21 22 23 24 32 33 38 39 46 46 47
it is made of such solid construction and since i have never had a mac using my iphone helped me get used to the system a bit .
0 2 3 5 6 10 11 13 14 18 19 24 25 37 38 41 42 47 48 49 50 54 55 60 61 64 65 66 67 70 71 76 77 79 80 86 87 93 94 96 97 100 101 105 106 108 109 112 113 119 120 121 122 125 125 126
i love this piece of equipment , it will be hard to go back to other type of laptop after using a macbook pro .
0 1 2 6 7 11 12 17 18 20 21 30 30 31 32 34 35 39 40 42 43 47 48 50 51 53 54 58 59 61 62 67 68 72 73 75 76 82 83 88 89 94 95 96 97 104 105 108 108 109
very nice unibody construction .
0 4 5 9 10 17 18 30 30 31
very disappointed with apple .
0 4 5 17 18 22 23 28 28 29
this macbook pro is fast , powerful , and runs super quiet and cool .
0 4 5 12 13 16 17 19 20 24 24 25 26 34 34 35 36 39 40 44 45 50 51 56 57 60 61 65 65 66
*** the review below is no longer relevant , apple has fixed the issue .
0 3 3 6 7 13 14 19 20 22 23 25 26 32 33 41 41 42 43 48 49 52 53 58 59 62 63 68 68 69
it 's ok but does n't have a disk drive which i did n't know until after i bought it .
0 2 2 4 5 7 8 11 12 16 16 19 20 24 25 26 27 31 32 37 38 43 44 45 46 49 49 52 53 57 58 63 64 69 70 71 72 78 79 81 81 82
there is no hdmi receptacle , nor is there an sd card slot located anywhere on the device .
0 5 6 8 9 11 12 16 17 27 27 28 29 32 33 35 36 41 42 44 45 47 48 52 53 57 58 65 66 74 75 77 78 81 82 88 88 89
it really is very light compared to other computers .
0 2 3 9 10 12 13 17 18 23 24 32 33 35 36 41 42 51 51 52
it came in brand new and works perfectly .
0 2 3 7 8 10 11 16 17 20 21 24 25 30 31 40 40 41
this machine is a-mazing .
0 4 5 12 13 15 16 24 24 25
it should n't happen like that , i do n't have any design app open or anything .
0 2 3 9 9 12 13 19 20 24 25 29 29 30 31 32 33 35 35 38 39 43 44 47 48 54 55 58 59 63 64 66 67 75 75 76
my trackpad is not working .
0 2 3 11 12 14 15 18 19 26 26 27
i just hope this expensive laptop does n't go dead like my friends ... it did last him 5 good years before it bit the dust .
0 1 2 6 7 11 12 16 17 26 27 33 34 38 38 41 42 44 45 49 50 54 55 57 58 65 65 68 68 70 71 74 75 79 80 83 84 85 86 90 91 96 97 103 104 106 107 110 111 114 115 119 119 120
considering another computer should be out of the question
0 11 12 19 20 28 29 35 36 38 39 42 43 45 46 49 50 58
it looks and feels solid , with a flawless finish .
0 2 3 8 9 12 13 18 19 24 24 25 26 30 31 32 33 41 42 48 48 49
its worth every penny .
0 3 4 9 10 15 16 21 21 22
price was higher when purchased on mac when compared to price showing on pc when i bought this product .
0 5 6 9 10 16 17 21 22 31 32 34 35 38 39 43 44 52 53 55 56 61 62 69 70 72 73 75 76 80 81 82 83 89 90 94 95 102 102 103
this was a great deal for a decked out macbook pro .
0 4 5 8 9 10 11 16 17 21 22 25 26 27 28 34 35 38 39 46 47 50 50 51
then the system would many times not power down without a forced power-off .
0 4 5 8 9 15 16 21 22 26 27 32 33 36 37 42 43 47 48 55 56 57 58 64 65 74 74 75
get this instead , you wo n't be sorry .
0 3 4 8 9 16 16 17 18 21 22 24 24 27 28 30 31 36 36 37
the configuration is perfect for my needs .
0 3 4 17 18 20 21 28 29 32 33 35 36 41 41 42
and the speakers is the worst ever .
0 3 4 7 8 16 17 19 20 23 24 29 30 34 34 35
i think it was around 16 hundred bucks last i checked .
0 1 2 7 8 10 11 14 15 21 22 24 25 32 33 38 39 43 44 45 46 53 53 54
its the best , its got the looks , super easy to use and love all you can do with the trackpad ! . .
0 3 4 7 8 12 12 13 14 17 18 21 22 25 26 31 31 32 33 38 39 43 44 46 47 50 51 54 55 59 60 63 64 67 68 71 72 74 75 79 80 83 84 92 92 93 93 94 94 95
it 's fast , quiet , incredibly small and affordable compared to other mac models .
0 2 2 4 5 9 9 10 11 16 16 17 18 28 29 34 35 38 39 49 50 58 59 61 62 67 68 71 72 78 78 79
web surfuring is smooth and seamless .
0 3 4 13 14 16 17 23 24 27 28 36 36 37
it was so exciting for me to unwrapp my new mac .
0 2 3 6 7 9 10 18 19 22 23 25 26 28 29 36 37 39 40 43 44 47 47 48
i 'm overall pleased with the interface and the portability of this product .
0 1 1 3 4 11 12 19 20 24 25 28 29 38 39 42 43 46 47 58 59 61 62 66 67 74 74 75
so when i had the money to buy one i bought other things instead ... a 700 laptop and some extra stuff with it .
0 2 3 7 8 9 10 13 14 17 18 23 24 26 27 30 31 34 35 36 37 43 44 49 50 56 57 64 64 68 68 69 70 73 74 80 81 84 85 89 90 95 96 101 102 106 107 109 109 110
this item is a beautiful piece , it works well , it is easy to carry and handle .
0 4 5 9 10 12 13 14 15 24 25 30 30 31 32 34 35 40 41 45 45 46 47 49 50 52 53 57 58 60 61 66 67 70 71 77 77 78
see retired recently and decided that she wanted a laptop .
0 3 4 11 12 20 21 24 25 32 33 37 38 41 42 48 49 50 51 57 57 58
it was also suffering from hardware -lrb- keyboard -rrb- issues , relatively slow performance and shortening battery lifetime .
0 2 3 6 7 11 12 21 22 26 27 35 36 37 37 45 45 46 47 53 53 54 55 65 66 70 71 82 83 86 87 97 98 105 106 114 114 115

0 4 5 9 10 13 14 18 19 22 23 26 26 27 28 30 30 33 34 42 43 48 49 53 53 54
it 's silent and has a very small footprint on my desk .
0 2 2 4 5 11 12 15 16 19 20 21 22 26 27 32 33 42 43 45 46 48 49 53 53 54
i have nothing to regret from this new product .
0 1 2 6 7 14 15 17 18 24 25 29 30 34 35 38 39 46 46 47
the exterior is absolutely gorgeous .

have one myself and love it !
0 4 5 8 9 15 16 19 20 24 25 27 27 28
it has a very high performance , just for what i needed for .

this is especially disheartening when apple prides itself as the choice of creative professionals .
0 4 5 7 8 18 19 32 33 37 38 43 44 50 51 57 58 60 61 64 65 71 72 74 75 83 84 97 97 98
apple is aware of this issue and this is either old stock or a defective design involving the intel 4000 graphics chipset .
0 5 6 8 9 14 15 17 18 22 23 28 29 32 33 37 38 40 41 47 48 51 52 57 58 60 61 62 63 72 73 79 80 89 90 93 94 99 100 104 105 113 114 121 121 122
stop living in the stone age and buy a mac , you will not be sorry at all !!

0 5 6 9 10 11 12 16 17 20 21 25 25 26

so glad i have gone this route !!
0 2 3 7 8 9 10 14 15 19 20 24 25 30 30 32
it wakes in less than a second when i open the lid .
0 2 3 8 9 11 12 16 17 21 22 23 24 30 31 35 36 37 38 42 43 46 47 50 50 51

trashed it when i spilled a latte on it while writing at a cafe .

my last laptop was a 17 '' asus gaming machine , which performed admirably , but having since built my own desktop and really settling into the college life , i found myself wanting something smaller and less cumbersome , not to mention that the asus had been slowly developing problems ever since i bought it about 4 years ago .

however , it did not have any scratches , zero battery cycle count -lrb- pretty surprised -rrb- , and all the hardware seemed to be working perfectly .
0 7 7 8 9 11 12 15 16 19 20 24 25 28 29 38 38 39 40 44 45 52 53 58 59 64 65 66 66 72 73 82 82 83 83 84 85 88 89 92 93 96 97 105 106 112 113 115 116 118 119 126 127 136 136 137
after fumbling around with the os i started searching the internet for a fix and found a number of forums on fixing the issue .
0 5 6 14 15 21 22 26 27 30 31 33 34 35 36 43 44 53 54 57 58 66 67 70 71 72 73 76 77 80 81 86 87 88 89 95 96 98 99 105 106 108 109 115 116 119 120 125 125 126
i could n't be more pleased .
0 1 2 7 7 10 11 13 14 18 19 26 26 27
and as for all the fancy finger swipes -- i just gave up and attached a mouse .
0 3 4 6 7 10 11 14 15 18 19 24 25 31 32 38 39 41 42 43 44 48 49 53 54 56 57 60 61 69 70 71 72 77 77 78
i needed a laptop with big storage , a nice screen and fast so i can photoshop without any problem .

i like coming back to mac os but this laptop is lacking in speaker quality compared to my $ 400 old hp laptop .
0 1 2 6 7 13 14 18 19 21 22 25 26 28 29 32 33 37 38 44 45 47 48 55 56 58 59 66 67 74 75 83 84 86 87 89 90 91 91 94 96 99 100 102 103 109 109 110
it is much better than the acer ultrabook i had before .
0 2 3 5 6 10 11 17 18 22 23 26 27 31 32 41 42 43 44 47 48 54 54 55
shipped very quickly and safely .
0 7 8 12 13 20 21 24 25 31 31 32
i finally own a piece of computing equipment that i do n't want to take a baseball bat and destroy .
0 1 2 9 10 13 14 15 16 21 22 24 25 34 35 44 45 49 50 51 52 54 54 57 58 62 63 65 66 70 71 72 73 81 82 85 86 89 90 97 97 98
the thunderbolt port is awesome !
0 3 4 15 16 20 21 23 24 31 31 32

the performance is definitely superior to any computer i 've ever put my hands on .
0 3 4 15 16 18 19 29 30 38 39 41 42 45 46 54 55 56 56 59 60 64 65 68 69 71 72 77 78 80 80 81

0 2 2 4 5 10 11 14 15 24 25 30 31 34 35 40 41 54 55 59 59 60
apple did a great job .
0 5 6 9 10 11 12 17 18 21 21 22
i like the design and its features but there are somethings i think needs to be improved .
0 1 2 6 7 10 11 17 18 21 22 25 26 34 35 38 39 44 45 48 49 59 60 61 62 67 68 73 74 76 77 79 80 88 88 89
there were small problems with mac office .
0 5 6 10 11 16 17 25 26 30 31 34 35 41 41 42
it is extremely fast and very compact .
0 2 3 5 6 15 16 20 21 24 25 29 30 37 37 38
i understand i should call apple tech support about any variables -lrb- which is my purpose of writing this con -rrb- as variables could be a bigger future problem .
0 1 2 12 13 14 15 21 22 26 27 32 33 37 38 45 46 51 52 55 56 65 65 66 66 71 72 74 75 77 78 85 86 88 89 96 97 101 102 105 105 106 107 109 110 119 120 125 126 128 129 130 131 137 138 144 145 152 152 153
i ordered my 2012 mac mini after being disappointed with spec of the new 27 '' imacs .
0 1 2 9 10 12 13 17 18 21 22 26 27 32 33 38 39 51 52 56 57 61 62 64 65 68 69 72 73 75 75 76 77 82 82 83
it still works and it 's extremely user friendly , so i would recommend it for new computer user and also for those who are just looking for a more efficient way to do things
0 2 3 8 9 14 15 18 19 21 21 23 24 33 34 38 39 47 47 48 49 51 52 53 54 59 60 69 70 72 73 76 77 80 81 89 90 94 95 98 99 103 104 107 108 113 114 117 118 121 122 126 127 134 135 138 139 140 141 145 146 155 156 159 160 162 163 165 166 172

-lrb- but office can be purchased -rrb- if i ever need a laptop again i am for sure purchasing another toshiba !!

i have n't tried the one with retina display ... maybe in the future .
0 1 2 6 6 9 10 15 16 19 20 23 24 28 29 35 36 43 43 46 47 52 53 55 56 59 60 66 66 67
you can read all about the details of this marvelous computer on wikipedia .
0 3 4 7 8 12 13 16 17 22 23 26 27 34 35 37 38 42 43 52 53 61 62 64 65 74 74 75
performance is much much better on the pro , especially if you install an ssd on it .
0 11 12 14 15 19 20 24 25 31 32 34 35 38 39 42 42 43 44 54 55 57 58 61 62 69 70 72 73 76 77 79 80 82 82 83
note , however , that any existing magsafe accessories you have will not work with the magsafe 2 connection .
0 4 4 5 6 13 13 14 15 19 20 23 24 32 33 40 41 52 53 56 57 61 62 66 67 70 71 75 76 80 81 84 85 92 93 94 95 105 105 106
if you get a lemon -lrb- i have two thirds of my macs -rrb- , you have to send it in for repairs several times before they will replace it , even if they have numerous problems with the same version of their computers .
0 2 3 6 7 10 11 12 13 18 19 20 20 21 22 26 27 30 31 37 38 40 41 43 45 49 49 50 50 51 52 55 56 60 61 63 64 68 69 71 72 74 75 78 79 86 87 94 95 100 101 107 108 112 113 117 118 125 126 128 128 129 130 134 135 137 138 142 143 147 148 156 157 165 166 170 171 174 175 179 180 187 188 190 191 196 197 206 206 207
the only thing i dislike is the touchpad , alot of the times its unresponsive and does things i dont want it too , i would recommend using a mouse with it .
0 3 4 8 9 14 15 16 17 24 25 27 28 31 32 40 40 41 42 46 47 49 50 53 54 59 60 63 64 76 77 80 81 85 86 92 93 94 95 99 100 104 105 107 108 111 111 112 113 114 115 120 121 130 131 136 137 138 139 144 145 149 150 152 152 153
yeah , it 's super expensive .
0 4 4 5 6 8 8 10 11 16 17 26 26 27
the mac mini is about 8x smaller than my old computer which is a huge bonus and runs very quiet , actually the fans are n't audible unlike my old pc
0 3 4 7 8 12 13 15 16 21 22 24 25 32 33 37 38 40 41 44 45 53 54 59 60 62 63 64 65 69 70 75 76 79 80 84 85 89 90 95 95 96 97 105 106 109 110 114 115 118 118 121 122 129 130 136 137 139 140 143 144 146
maybe the mac os improvement were not the product they want to offer .
0 5 6 9 10 13 14 16 17 28 29 33 34 37 38 41 42 49 50 54 55 59 60 62 63 68 68 69
it came before the day it supposed to which is great .
0 2 3 7 8 14 15 18 19 22 23 25 26 34 35 37 38 43 44 46 47 52 52 53
i thought the transition would be difficult at best and would take some time to fully familiarize myself with the new mac ecosystem .
0 1 2 9 10 13 14 24 25 30 31 33 34 43 44 46 47 51 52 55 56 61 62 66 67 71 72 76 77 79 80 85 86 97 98 104 105 109 110 113 114 117 118 121 122 131 131 132
it 's absolutely wonderful and worth the price !
0 2 2 4 5 15 16 25 26 29 30 35 36 39 40 45 45 46
it 's a good fix , in my opinion .
0 2 2 4 5 6 7 11 12 15 15 16 17 19 20 22 23 30 30 31
i am please with the products ease of use ; out of the box ready ; appearance and functionality .
0 1 2 4 5 11 12 16 17 20 21 29 30 34 35 37 38 41 41 42 43 46 47 49 50 53 54 57 58 63 63 64 65 75 76 79 80 93 93 94
buying a mac mini would allow me to make the transition .
0 6 7 8 9 12 13 17 18 23 24 29 30 32 33 35 36 40 41 44 45 55 55 56
before i begin , i will say that i am not like a good percentage of the people that will end up writing a review on this computer - i am not an apple fanboy .
0 6 7 8 9 14 14 15 16 17 18 22 23 26 27 31 32 33 34 36 37 40 41 45 46 47 48 52 53 63 64 66 67 70 71 77 78 82 83 87 88 91 92 94 95 102 103 104 105 111 112 114 115 119 120 128 129 130 131 132 133 135 136 139 140 142 143 148 149 155 155 156
its by far faster and more stable then my pc .
0 3 4 6 7 10 11 17 18 21 22 26 27 33 34 38 39 41 42 44 44 45
i purchased a macbook pro and this to replace a couple of hp units that i was using .

you will not regret it , promise you !
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 19 20 22 22 23 24 31 32 35 35 36
moving from a pc to mac has never been easier , and i 'm glad that i did it .

have used only macs for years .
0 4 5 9 10 14 15 19 20 23 24 29 29 30
being a tech savvy , apple - product loving person , i 'm glad i finally got the macbook pro !
0 5 6 7 8 12 13 18 18 19 20 25 26 27 28 35 36 42 43 49 49 50 51 52 52 54 55 59 60 61 62 69 70 73 74 77 78 85 86 89 89 90
i was always against them but now i buying one i 'll never go back to pc .
0 1 2 5 6 12 13 20 21 25 26 29 30 33 34 35 36 42 43 46 47 48 48 51 52 57 58 60 61 65 66 68 69 71 71 72
i will not be using that slot again .
0 1 2 6 7 10 11 13 14 19 20 24 25 29 30 35 35 36
i think that was a great decision to buy
0 1 2 7 8 12 13 16 17 18 19 24 25 33 34 36 37 40
the os is fast and fluid , everything is organized and it 's just beautiful .
0 3 4 6 7 9 10 14 15 18 19 24 24 25 26 36 37 39 40 49 50 53 54 56 56 58 59 63 64 73 73 74
it will make life so much easier next semester , just wish i had it last semester !!

i paid for a new laptop , but was sent a used one .
0 1 2 6 7 10 11 12 13 16 17 23 23 24 25 28 29 32 33 37 38 39 40 44 45 48 48 49
searched it on amazon and on bestbuy .
0 8 9 11 12 14 15 21 22 25 26 28 29 36 36 37
i bought this one for my 11 year old and the macbook air for my 9 year old .
0 1 2 8 9 13 14 17 18 21 22 24 25 27 28 32 33 36 37 40 41 44 45 52 53 56 57 60 61 63 64 65 66 70 71 74 74 75
i bought it for college and so far it 's amazing !
0 1 2 8 9 11 12 15 16 23 24 27 28 30 31 34 35 37 37 39 40 47 47 48
they are simpler to use .
0 4 5 8 9 16 17 19 20 23 23 24
it was at my door in less than 24 hours .

you can imagine that an expensive item as a laptop will not be left on your front steps , it needs signature to pove that you received it .
0 3 4 7 8 15 16 20 21 23 24 33 34 38 39 41 42 43 44 50 51 55 56 59 60 62 63 67 68 70 71 75 76 81 82 87 87 88 89 91 92 97 98 107 108 110 111 115 116 120 121 124 125 133 134 136 136 137

the technical support was not helpful as well .
0 3 4 13 14 21 22 25 26 29 30 37 38 40 41 45 45 46
i got the new adapter and there was no change .

having heard from friends and family about how reliable a mac product is , i never expected to have an application crash within the first month , but i did .

not super light but still a good one .
0 3 4 9 10 15 16 19 20 25 26 27 28 32 33 36 36 37
the mini 's body has n't changed since late 2010 - and for a good reason .

put a cover on it and is a little better but that is my only complaint .
0 3 4 5 6 11 12 14 15 17 18 21 22 24 25 26 27 33 34 40 41 44 45 49 50 52 53 55 56 60 61 70 70 71

it is pretty snappy and starts up in about 30 seconds which is good enough for me .
0 2 3 5 6 12 13 19 20 23 24 30 31 33 34 36 37 42 43 45 46 53 54 59 60 62 63 67 68 74 75 78 79 81 81 82
the few things that are wrong with it are very minor things .

so noise is reduced at least 50 % and the heat is much better , now it does n't feel hot but warm .

i am very satisfied with the mini .
0 1 2 4 5 9 10 19 20 24 25 28 29 33 33 34
the audio volume is quite low and virtually unusable in a room with any background activity .

0 1 2 4 5 10 11 13 14 21 22 26 27 31 32 35 36 37 38 44 45 46 47 54 54 55 56 63 64 72 73 76 77 80 81 86 87 88 89 91 92 98 99 101 102 108 108 109
in the short time of one month since the 2012 mac mini was released there are well over 1000 posts regarding this issue and the numbers keep rising .
0 2 3 6 7 12 13 17 18 20 21 24 25 30 31 36 37 40 41 45 46 49 50 54 55 58 59 67 68 73 74 77 78 82 83 87 88 92 93 98 99 108 109 113 114 119 120 123 124 127 128 135 136 140 141 147 147 148

0 1 2 5 6 8 9 16 17 19 20 23 24 28 29 31 32 35 36 40 41 42 43 49 50 54 55 61 62 63 64 69 70 76 76 77

more likely it will require replacing the logic board once they admit they have a problem and come up with a solution .
0 4 5 11 12 14 15 19 20 27 28 37 38 41 42 47 48 53 54 58 59 63 64 69 70 74 75 79 80 81 82 89 90 93 94 98 99 101 102 106 107 108 109 117 117 118

i like the mini mac it was easy to setup and install , but i am learning as i go and could use a tutorial to learn how to use some of the features i was use to on the pc especially the right mouse click menu .

0 4 5 9 10 15 15 16
all the above aside this machine rocks !

since the machine 's slim profile is critical to me , that was a problem .
0 5 6 9 10 17 17 19 20 24 25 32 33 35 36 44 45 47 48 50 50 51 52 56 57 60 61 62 63 70 70 71

after all was said and done , i essentially used that $ 450 savings to buy 16gb of ram , two seagate momentus xt hybrid drives and an owc upgrade kit to install the second hard drive .

i was concerned that the downgrade to the regular hard drive would make it unacceptably slow but i need not have worried - this machine is the fastest i have ever owned ...

0 5 6 7 8 14 15 20 21 24 25 26 27 33 34 39 40 46 46 47
it is the best laptop ever !!!
0 2 3 5 6 9 10 14 15 21 22 26 26 29
my laptop with windows 7 crashed and i did not want windows 8 .
0 2 3 9 10 14 15 22 23 24 25 32 33 36 37 38 39 42 43 46 47 51 52 59 60 61 61 62
was skeptical about buying an electronic item online but it turned out to be a positive experience .
0 3 4 13 14 19 20 26 27 29 30 40 41 45 46 52 53 56 57 59 60 66 67 70 71 73 74 76 77 78 79 87 88 98 98 99
not a scratch or mark on it .
0 3 4 5 6 13 14 16 17 21 22 24 25 27 27 28
easy to install also small to leave anywhere at your bedroom also very easy to configure for adsl cable or wifi .
0 4 5 7 8 15 16 20 21 26 27 29 30 35 36 44 45 47 48 52 53 60 61 65 66 70 71 75 76 78 79 88 89 92 93 97 98 103 104 106 107 111 111 112
words can not express how much i love my new mac .
0 5 6 9 9 12 13 20 21 24 25 29 30 31 32 36 37 39 40 43 44 47 47 48
the speakers could have been better but it was n't a deal breaker ... this is a great little laptop ... love it !
0 3 4 12 13 18 19 23 24 28 29 35 36 39 40 42 43 46 46 49 50 51 52 56 57 64 64 67 68 72 73 75 76 77 78 83 84 90 91 97 97 100 101 105 106 108 108 109
the item received was exactly as identified .
0 3 4 8 9 17 18 21 22 29 30 32 33 43 43 44
its everything mac offers .
0 3 4 14 15 18 19 25 25 26
nice packing .
0 4 5 12 12 13
besides being elegant , the macbooks are durable .
0 7 8 13 14 21 21 22 23 26 27 35 36 39 40 47 47 48
i switched to this because i wanted something different , even though i miss windows .
0 1 2 10 11 13 14 18 19 26 27 28 29 35 36 45 46 55 55 56 57 61 62 68 69 70 71 75 76 83 83 84
yes , the mbp is more expensive than competing pc laptops .
0 3 3 4 5 8 9 12 13 15 16 20 21 30 31 35 36 45 46 48 49 56 56 57
apple no longer includes idvd with the computer and furthermore , apple does n't even offer it anymore !
0 5 6 8 9 15 16 24 25 29 30 34 35 38 39 47 48 51 52 63 63 64 65 70 71 75 75 78 79 83 84 89 90 92 93 100 100 101
i also wanted windows 7 , which this one has .
0 1 2 6 7 13 14 21 22 23 23 24 25 30 31 35 36 39 40 43 43 44
at first , i feel a little bit uncomfortable in using the mac system .
0 2 3 8 8 9 10 11 12 16 17 18 19 25 26 29 30 43 44 46 47 52 53 56 57 60 61 67 67 68
i am used to computers with windows so i am having a little difficulty finding my way around .
0 1 2 4 5 9 10 12 13 22 23 27 28 35 36 38 39 40 41 43 44 50 51 52 53 59 60 70 71 78 79 81 82 85 86 92 92 93
they replaced it and so far so good .
0 4 5 13 14 16 17 20 21 23 24 27 28 30 31 35 35 36
it just works out of the box and you have a lot of cool software included with the os .
0 2 3 7 8 13 14 17 18 20 21 24 25 28 29 32 33 36 37 41 42 43 44 47 48 50 51 55 56 64 65 73 74 78 79 82 83 85 85 86
good in every aspect .
0 4 5 7 8 13 14 20 20 21
its as advertised on here ... . it works great and is not a waste of money !
0 3 4 6 7 17 18 20 21 25 25 29 29 30 31 33 34 39 40 45 46 49 50 52 53 56 57 58 59 64 65 67 68 73 73 74
replaced this one with my mac that was stolen , its a great computer .
0 8 9 13 14 17 18 22 23 25 26 29 30 34 35 38 39 45 45 46 47 50 51 52 53 58 59 67 67 68
just be careful ; you always have to give up some good stuff for others .
0 4 5 7 8 15 15 16 17 20 21 27 28 32 33 35 36 40 41 43 44 48 49 53 54 59 60 63 64 70 70 71
runs like a champ ...
0 4 5 9 10 11 12 17 17 22
really great ... well let me start at the beginning .
0 6 7 12 12 15 15 19 20 23 24 26 27 32 33 35 36 39 40 49 49 50
premium price for the os more than anything else .
0 7 8 13 14 17 18 21 22 24 25 29 30 34 35 43 44 48 48 49
this was a gift for my grand son .
0 4 5 8 9 10 11 15 16 19 20 22 23 28 29 32 32 33
i was a little concerned about the touch pad based on reviews , but i 've found it fine to work with .
0 1 2 5 6 7 8 14 15 24 25 30 31 34 35 40 41 44 45 50 51 53 54 61 61 62 63 66 67 68 68 71 72 77 78 80 81 85 86 88 89 93 94 98 98 99
i bought this mac book pro along with a new 27 '' imac and while they are still light years more reliable than a pc i have noticed a decline in the reliability of my mac computers .
0 1 2 8 9 13 14 17 18 22 23 26 27 32 33 37 38 39 40 43 44 46 46 47 48 52 53 56 57 62 63 67 68 71 72 77 78 83 84 89 90 94 95 103 104 108 109 110 111 113 114 115 116 120 121 128 129 130 131 138 139 141 142 145 146 157 158 160 161 163 164 167 168 177 177 178
the sound as mentioned earlier is n't the best , but it can be solved with headphones .
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 22 23 30 31 33 33 36 37 40 41 45 45 46 47 50 51 53 54 57 58 60 61 67 68 72 73 83 83 84
the track pad is a bit squirrely at times - sometimes too sensitive , and sometimes a bit unresponsive , but it 's usable .
0 3 4 9 10 13 14 16 17 18 19 22 23 32 33 35 36 41 41 42 43 52 53 56 57 66 66 67 68 71 72 81 82 83 84 87 88 100 100 101 102 105 106 108 108 110 111 117 117 118
however , the experience was great since the os does not become unstable and the application will simply shutdown and reopen .
0 7 7 8 9 12 13 23 24 27 28 33 34 39 40 43 44 46 47 51 52 55 56 62 63 71 72 75 76 79 80 91 92 96 97 103 104 112 113 116 117 123 123 124
then only four months later , my great macbook pro failed .
0 4 5 9 10 14 15 21 22 27 27 28 29 31 32 37 38 45 46 49 50 56 56 57
if you ask me , for this price it should be included .
0 2 3 6 7 10 11 13 13 14 15 18 19 23 24 29 30 32 33 39 40 42 43 51 51 52
the battery is not as shown in the product photos .
0 3 4 11 12 14 15 18 19 21 22 27 28 30 31 34 35 42 43 49 49 50
even though i could have gotten a pc twice the speed for the same price i still think there 's nothing like a mac .
0 4 5 11 12 13 14 19 20 24 25 31 32 33 34 36 37 42 43 46 47 52 53 56 57 60 61 65 66 71 72 73 74 79 80 85 86 91 91 93 94 101 102 106 107 108 109 112 112 113
seems a much more economical way to get into apple than their other computers .
0 5 6 7 8 12 13 17 18 28 29 32 33 35 36 39 40 44 45 50 51 55 56 61 62 67 68 77 77 78
shipping was quick and product described was the product sent and so much more ...
0 8 9 12 13 18 19 22 23 30 31 40 41 44 45 48 49 56 57 61 62 65 66 68 69 73 74 78 78 81
i 'm so disgusted that i wasted my money on this product .
0 1 1 3 4 6 7 16 17 21 22 23 24 30 31 33 34 39 40 42 43 47 48 55 55 56
all you get is a box and a computer .
0 3 4 7 8 11 12 14 15 16 17 20 21 24 25 26 27 35 35 36
the retina display display make pictures i took years ago jaw dropping .
0 3 4 10 11 18 19 26 27 31 32 40 41 42 43 47 48 53 54 57 58 61 62 70 70 71
its only crashed on me one time in the 3 months i 've had it .
0 3 4 8 9 16 17 19 20 22 23 26 27 31 32 34 35 38 39 40 41 47 48 49 49 52 53 56 57 59 59 60
the mac mini is probably the simplest example of compact computing out there .
0 3 4 7 8 12 13 15 16 24 25 28 29 37 38 45 46 48 49 56 57 66 67 70 71 76 76 77
instead , i 'll focus more on the actual performance and feature set of the hardware itself so you can make an educated decision on which mac to buy .
0 7 7 8 9 10 10 13 14 19 20 24 25 27 28 31 32 38 39 50 51 54 55 62 63 66 67 69 70 73 74 82 83 89 90 92 93 96 97 100 101 105 106 108 109 117 118 126 127 129 130 135 136 139 140 142 143 146 146 147
my bag just got a little lighter .
0 2 3 6 7 11 12 15 16 17 18 24 25 32 32 33
i 'm not exagerating when i say this computer is perfect . . i it is !!
0 1 1 3 4 7 8 19 20 24 25 26 27 30 31 35 36 44 45 47 48 55 55 56 56 57 57 58 59 61 62 64 64 66
this machine is flawless , fast , and classy .
0 4 5 12 13 15 16 24 24 25 26 30 30 31 32 35 36 42 42 43
other ports include firewire 800 , gigabit ethernet , magsafe port , microphone jack .
0 5 6 11 12 19 20 28 29 32 32 33 34 41 42 50 50 51 52 59 60 64 64 65 66 76 77 81 81 82
i stayed up half the night enjoying my new macbook pro .
0 1 2 8 9 11 12 16 17 20 21 26 27 35 36 38 39 42 43 50 51 54 54 55
this laptop is a 100 times better than a chromebook !
0 4 5 11 12 14 15 16 17 20 21 26 27 33 34 38 39 40 41 51 51 52
additionally , there is barely a ventilation system in the computer , and even the simple activity of watching videos let alone playing steam games causes the laptop to get very very hot , and in fact impossible to keep on lap .
0 12 12 13 14 19 20 22 23 29 30 31 32 43 44 50 51 53 54 57 58 66 66 67 68 71 72 76 77 80 81 87 88 96 97 99 100 108 109 115 116 119 120 125 126 133 134 139 140 145 146 152 153 156 157 163 164 166 167 170 171 175 176 180 181 184 184 185 186 189 190 192 193 197 198 208 209 211 212 216 217 219 220 223 223 224
at $ 1899 to start , this is no cheap machine .
0 2 3 4 4 8 9 11 12 17 17 18 19 23 24 26 27 29 30 35 36 43 43 44
chatting with acer support , i was advised the problem was corrupted operating system files .
0 8 9 13 14 18 19 26 26 27 28 29 30 33 34 41 42 45 46 53 54 57 58 67 68 77 78 84 85 90 90 91
it 's been a couple weeks since the purchase and i 'm struggle with finding the correct keys -lrb- but that was expected -rrb- .
0 2 2 4 5 9 10 11 12 18 19 24 25 30 31 34 35 43 44 47 48 49 49 51 52 60 61 65 66 73 74 77 78 85 86 90 91 92 92 95 96 100 101 104 105 113 113 114 114 115
many people complain about the new os , and it 's urgent for apple to fix it asap !
0 4 5 11 12 20 21 26 27 30 31 34 35 37 37 38 39 42 43 45 45 47 48 54 55 58 59 64 65 67 68 71 72 74 75 79 79 80
now that i have upgraded to lion i am much happier about mac os and have just bought an imac for office .
0 3 4 8 9 10 11 15 16 24 25 27 28 32 33 34 35 37 38 42 43 50 51 56 57 60 61 63 64 67 68 72 73 77 78 84 85 87 88 92 93 96 97 103 103 104
user upgradeable ram and hdd .
0 4 5 16 17 20 21 24 25 28 28 29
but i wanted the pro for the cd/dvd player .
0 3 4 5 6 12 13 16 17 20 21 24 25 28 29 35 36 42 42 43
i might have read it incorrectly , but better safe than sorry right ?
0 1 2 7 8 12 13 17 18 20 21 32 32 33 34 37 38 44 45 49 50 54 55 60 61 66 66 67
the ultimate graduation gift .
0 3 4 12 13 23 24 28 28 29
the ram memory is good but should have splurged for 8mb instead of 4mb .
0 3 4 7 8 14 15 17 18 22 23 26 27 33 34 38 39 47 48 51 52 55 56 63 64 66 67 70 70 71
was debating to buy one for months , checked out different stuff on youtube , and read different articles and debates , i just didnt really wan na spend the money but im glad that i did .
0 3 4 12 13 15 16 19 20 23 24 27 28 34 34 35 36 43 44 47 48 57 58 63 64 66 67 74 74 75 76 79 80 84 85 94 95 103 104 107 108 115 115 116 116 117 118 122 123 128 129 135 136 139 139 141 142 147 148 151 152 157 158 161 162 164 165 169 170 174 175 176 177 180 180 181
i love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention pc 's require .
0 1 2 6 7 9 10 13 14 19 20 29 30 32 33 35 36 44 45 48 49 51 52 57 58 60 61 64 65 73 74 83 84 86 86 88 89 96 96 97
i was a little worry at first because i do n't have a lot of experience with os.x and windows has always been second nature to me after many years of using windows .
0 1 2 5 6 7 8 14 15 20 21 23 24 29 30 37 38 39 40 42 42 45 46 50 51 52 53 56 57 59 60 70 71 75 76 80 81 84 85 92 93 96 97 103 104 108 109 115 116 122 123 125 126 128 129 134 135 139 140 145 146 148 149 154 155 162 162 163
i am an info sys major in college , so i started researching this issue on my own .
0 1 2 4 5 7 8 12 13 16 17 22 23 25 26 33 33 34 35 37 38 39 40 47 48 59 60 64 65 70 71 73 74 76 77 80 80 81
solution : it turned out to be pretty simple .
0 8 8 9 10 12 13 19 20 23 24 26 27 29 30 36 37 43 43 44
with the softwares supporting the use of other os makes it much better .
0 4 5 8 9 18 19 29 30 33 34 37 38 40 41 46 47 49 50 55 56 58 59 63 64 70 70 71
still have n't solved this .
0 5 6 10 10 13 14 20 21 25 25 26
i then upgraded to mac os x 10.8 `` mountain lion '' .
0 1 2 6 7 15 16 18 19 22 23 25 26 27 28 32 33 34 34 42 43 47 47 48 48 49
it is extremely fast and never lags .
0 2 3 5 6 15 16 20 21 24 25 30 31 35 35 36
i told them that i just received my brand new macbook but i was having issues .

i was considering buying the air , but in reality , this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient , even though it 's about .20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier .

at home and the office it gets plugged into an external 24 '' lcd screen , so built in screen size is not terribly important .

i saw the bad reviews from people saying to buy directly from apple and i was concerned but i took my chances and am overly impressed .

the case is now slightly larger than the previous generation , but the lack of an external power supply justifies the small increase in size .

i had to buy a wireless mouse to go with it , as i am old school and hate the pad , but knew that before i bought it , now it works great , need to get adjusted to the key board , as i am used to a bigger one and pounding .

further , this mac mini has a sloppy bluetooth interface -lrb- courtesy of the mac os -rrb- and the range is poor .

a veryimportant feature is firewire 800 which in my experience works better then usb3 -lrb- in pc enabled with usb3 -rrb- i was not originally sold on the mac os i felt it was inferior in many ways to windows 7 .
