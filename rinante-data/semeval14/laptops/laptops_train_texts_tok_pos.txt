one night i turned the freaking thing off after using it , the next day i turn it on , no gui , screen all dark , power light steady , hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does .

my only disappointment with the 13 '' model is that they 're the only ones in the macbook pro line up without an i5 or i7 processor and dual graphics cards , however the trade-off is that you achieve a longer battery life -lrb- of about 2 more hours -rrb- .

i took it back for an asus and same thing - blue screen which required me to remove the battery to reset .

in the shop , these macbooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure - so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it , get it home , break the seal and use it -lrb- very clever con -rrb- .

however , the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary -lrb- unless you 're gaming -rrb- .

there also seemed to be a problem with the hard disc as certain times windows loads but claims to not be able to find any drivers or files .

i was happy with my purchase of a toshiba satellite l305d-s5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the toshiba warranty .
0 1 2 5 6 11 12 16 17 19 20 28 29 31 32 33 34 41 42 51 52 63 64 70 71 76 77 79 80 84 85 89 90 92 93 97 98 100 101 109 110 115 116 119 120 127 128 136 136 137

0 7 8 15 15 16
the fact that you can spend over $ 100 on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine .
0 3 4 8 9 13 14 17 18 21 22 27 28 32 33 34 34 37 38 40 41 45 46 47 48 54 55 66 67 70 71 76 77 79 80 84 85 92 92 93

a month or so ago , the freaking motherboard just died .
0 1 2 7 8 10 11 13 14 17 17 18 19 22 23 31 32 43 44 48 49 53 53 54
the system it comes with does not work properly , so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all .
0 3 4 10 11 13 14 19 20 24 25 29 30 33 34 38 39 47 47 48 49 51 52 56 57 63 64 66 67 70 71 74 75 83 84 88 89 91 92 94 95 102 103 106 107 114 115 117 118 121 121 122
then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so i was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running .
0 4 5 10 11 12 13 15 16 18 19 25 26 29 30 37 38 45 46 53 54 56 57 58 59 62 63 69 70 72 73 75 76 79 80 83 84 87 88 91 92 100 101 105 106 108 109 113 114 118 119 127 128 135 135 136
i took it back to best buy where they were so helpful and immediately gave me a new one .

if you had pc for four years i can almost gaurentee that something would of gone wrong by now , maybe even forcing you to replace your entire computer .

this laptop is insane !!!
0 4 5 11 12 14 15 21 21 24
if a website ever freezes -lrb- which is rare -rrb- , its really easy to force quit .
0 2 3 4 5 12 13 17 18 25 26 27 27 32 33 35 36 40 40 41 41 42 43 46 47 53 54 58 59 61 62 67 68 72 72 73

i also enjoy the fact that my macbook pro laptop allows me to run windows 7 on it by using the vmware program .
0 1 2 6 7 12 13 16 17 21 22 26 27 29 30 37 38 41 42 48 49 55 56 58 59 61 62 65 66 73 74 75 76 78 79 81 82 84 85 90 91 94 95 101 102 109 109 110

if you find yourself in the market for a new laptop -lrb- and have the money -rrb- do n't exclude looking at the mbps .

i did n't like one thing about it .
0 1 2 5 5 8 9 13 14 17 18 23 24 29 30 32 32 33
the battery life seems to be very good , and have had no issues with it .
0 3 4 11 12 16 17 22 23 25 26 28 29 33 34 38 38 39 40 43 44 48 49 52 53 55 56 62 63 67 68 70 70 71
enabling the battery timer is useless .

temperatures on the outside were alright but i did not track in core processing unit temperatures .

after about a week i finally got it back and was told that the motherboard had failed and so they installed a new motherboard .
0 5 6 11 12 13 14 18 19 20 21 28 29 32 33 35 36 40 41 44 45 48 49 53 54 58 59 62 63 74 75 78 79 85 86 89 90 92 93 97 98 107 108 109 110 113 114 125 125 126
trying to balance all of my roles leaves very little time for me to do anything , so i want to manage my time i do have to be the most efficient .

they had to replace the motherboard in april
0 4 5 8 9 11 12 19 20 23 24 35 36 38 39 44
yes , the computer was light weight , less expensive than the average laptop , and was pretty self explantory in use .
0 3 3 4 5 8 9 17 18 21 22 27 28 34 34 35 36 40 41 50 51 55 56 59 60 67 68 74 74 75 76 79 80 83 84 90 91 95 96 106 107 109 110 113 113 114
also , if you need to talk to a representive at microsoft , there is a charge , which i believe is robbery , since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system , which most people would have went with xp if they could .

the problem i had with this unit was unresolvable .
0 3 4 11 12 13 14 17 18 22 23 27 28 32 33 36 37 49 49 50
it weighed like seven pounds or something like that .
0 2 3 10 11 15 16 21 22 28 29 31 32 41 42 46 47 51 51 52
2 months later , the battery went .

you may need to special order a bag .
0 3 4 7 8 12 13 15 16 23 24 29 30 31 32 35 35 36
it 's color is even cool .
0 2 2 4 5 10 11 13 14 18 19 23 23 24
and it has blue screen crashed on me twice .
0 3 4 6 7 10 11 15 16 22 23 30 31 33 34 36 37 42 42 43

yes , a mac is much more money than the average laptop out there , but there is no comparison in style , speed and just cool factor .
0 3 3 4 5 6 7 10 11 13 14 18 19 23 24 29 30 34 35 38 39 46 47 53 54 57 58 63 63 64 65 68 69 74 75 77 78 80 81 91 92 94 95 100 100 101 102 107 108 111 112 116 117 121 122 128 128 129
he gave me this pc about 3 years ago and up to this point im still sitting here using it .
0 2 3 7 8 10 11 15 16 18 19 24 25 26 27 32 33 36 37 40 41 43 44 46 47 51 52 57 58 60 61 66 67 74 75 79 80 85 86 88 88 89
i 'm pleased .
0 1 1 3 4 11 11 12
the keyboard feels good and i type just fine on it .
0 3 4 12 13 18 19 23 24 27 28 29 30 34 35 39 40 44 45 47 48 50 50 51
with a healthy pessimism , i took the machine home and tried to find a flaw .
0 4 5 6 7 14 15 24 24 25 26 27 28 32 33 36 37 44 45 49 50 53 54 59 60 62 63 67 68 69 70 74 74 75
shiny this laptop is the best of the best !
0 5 7 11 12 18 19 21 22 25 26 30 31 33 34 37 38 42 42 43
i thought the white mac computers looked dirty too quicly where you use the mousepad and where you place your hands when typing .
0 1 2 9 10 13 14 19 20 23 24 33 34 40 41 46 47 50 51 57 58 63 64 67 68 71 72 75 76 84 85 88 89 94 95 98 99 104 105 109 110 115 116 120 121 127 127 128
and not to mention after using it for a few months or so , the battery will slowly less and less hold a charge until you ca n't leave it unplugged for more than 5 minutes without the thing dying .
0 3 4 7 8 10 11 18 19 24 25 30 31 33 34 37 38 39 40 43 44 50 51 53 54 56 56 57 58 61 62 69 70 74 75 81 82 86 87 90 91 95 96 100 101 102 103 109 110 115 116 119 120 122 122 125 126 131 132 134 135 144 145 148 149 153 154 158 159 160 161 168 169 176 177 180 181 186 187 192 192 193

money and time well spent !

gradually the freezing screen evolved into a screen that froze in weird shapes .

0 1 2 5 6 12 13 17 18 22 23 29 30 33 34 36 37 41 42 44 44 45
i am however pleased that it is still hanging in there .
2 3 4 6 7 14 15 22 23 27 28 30 31 33 34 39 40 47 48 50 51 56 56 57

no complaints with their desktop , and maybe because it just sits on your desktop , and you do n't carry it around , which could jar the hard drive , or the motherboard .
0 2 3 13 14 18 19 24 25 32 32 33 34 37 38 43 44 51 52 54 55 59 60 64 65 67 68 72 73 80 80 81 82 85 86 89 90 92 92 95 96 101 102 104 105 111 111 112 113 118 119 124 125 128 129 132 133 137 138 143 143 144 145 147 148 151 152 163 163 164
yes , they cost more , but they more than make up for it in speed , construction quality , and longevity .
0 3 3 4 5 9 10 14 15 19 19 20 21 24 25 29 30 34 35 39 40 44 45 47 48 51 52 54 55 57 58 63 63 64 65 77 78 85 85 86 87 90 91 100 100 101
since i keyboard over 100 wpm , i look for a unit that has a comfortble keyboard -lrb- no keys sticking or lagging , strange configuration of `` extra key '' , etc. .
0 5 6 7 8 16 17 21 22 25 26 29 29 30 31 32 33 37 38 41 42 43 44 48 49 53 54 57 58 59 60 70 71 79 80 81 81 83 84 88 89 97 98 100 101 108 108 109 110 117 118 131 132 134 135 136 136 141 142 145 145 146 146 147 148 151 151 152
-rrb- i also tried the touch pad and compared it to other netbooks in the store .
0 1 2 3 4 8 9 14 15 18 19 24 25 28 29 32 33 41 42 44 45 47 48 53 54 62 63 65 66 69 70 75 75 76
it absolutely is more expensive than most pc laptops , but the ease of use , security , and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag .
0 2 3 13 14 16 17 21 22 31 32 36 37 41 42 44 45 52 52 53 54 57 58 61 62 66 67 69 70 73 73 74 75 83 83 84 85 88 89 96 97 105 106 110 111 115 116 122 123 127 128 130 131 135 136 141 142 145 146 154 154 155
it gets stuck all of the time you use it , and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work .
2 4 5 9 10 15 16 19 20 22 23 26 27 31 32 35 36 39 40 42 42 43 44 47 48 51 52 56 57 59 60 64 65 72 73 75 76 78 79 81 82 85 86 88 89 91 92 96 96 97
lots of preloaded software .
0 4 5 7 8 17 18 26 26 27

breaking within 1 year of purchase and speaking to 4 + people to report the damaged part will be returned late !

0 4 5 13 14 18 19 25 26 32 32 33
will probably never buy a hp again .

i got tired of buying laptops and having them stop working after a year .

i should have been more observant .
0 1 2 8 9 13 14 18 19 23 24 33 33 34
i wish it had a webcam though , then it would be perfect !
0 1 2 6 7 9 10 13 14 15 16 22 23 29 29 30 31 35 36 38 39 44 45 47 48 55 55 56
my favorite part of this computer is that it has a vga port so i can connect it to a bigger screen .
0 2 3 11 12 16 17 19 20 24 25 33 34 36 37 41 42 44 45 48 49 50 51 54 55 59 60 62 63 64 65 68 69 76 77 79 80 82 83 84 85 91 92 98 98 99
another thing i might add is the battery life is excellent .
0 7 8 13 14 15 16 21 22 25 26 28 29 32 33 40 41 45 46 48 49 58 58 59
one drawback , i wish the keys were backlit .
0 3 4 12 12 13 14 15 16 20 21 24 25 29 30 34 35 42 42 43
when the buyer returned it wal mart just boxed it , taped it shut resold it as new .

acer was no help and garmin could not determine the problem -lrb- after spending about 2 hours with me -rrb- , so i returned it and purchased a toshiba r700 that seems even nicer and i was able to load all of my software with no problem .

i play a lot of casual games online , and the touchpad is very responsive .

granted , it 's still a very new laptop but in comparison to my previous laptops and desktops , my mac boots up noticeably quicker .
0 7 7 8 9 11 11 13 14 19 20 21 22 26 27 30 31 37 38 41 42 44 45 55 56 58 59 61 62 70 71 78 79 82 83 91 91 92 93 95 96 99 100 105 106 108 109 119 120 127 127 128
it caught a virus that completely wiped out my hard drive in a matter of hours .

it is everything i 'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint , but somehow a bit more sturdy .
0 2 3 5 6 16 17 18 18 20 21 26 27 29 30 35 36 38 39 43 44 45 46 50 51 54 55 59 60 70 70 71 72 75 76 83 84 85 86 89 90 94 95 101 101 102
the only fact i dont like about apples is they generally use safari and i dont use safari but after i install mozzilla firfox i love every single bit about it .

the bluetooth was not there at all , and the fingerprint reader driver would be there , but the software would hang after installation was 1/2 way done .

that whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $ 175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $ 175 and it was fixed .

who could n't love a dvd burner , 80-gigabyte hd , and fairly new graphics chip ? as i soon discovered , though , there is a reason for which similarly-configured sony and toshiba machines cost more : they use higher-quality components that are faster , better-configured , and end up lasting a lot longer .

falls into the case .

this is something i would deffinately reccomend to someone .
0 4 5 7 8 17 18 19 20 25 26 37 38 47 48 50 51 58 58 59
its fast and another thing i like is that it has three usb ports .

mac computers automatically `` defrag '' each time you start your computer .
0 3 4 13 14 27 28 29 29 35 35 36 37 41 42 46 47 50 51 56 57 61 62 70 70 71
that is my only complaint !
0 4 5 7 8 10 11 15 16 25 25 26
the salesman talked us into this computer away from another we were looking at and we have had nothing but problems with software problems and just not happy with it .
0 3 4 12 13 19 20 22 23 27 28 32 33 41 42 46 47 51 52 59 60 62 63 67 68 75 76 78 79 82 83 85 86 90 91 94 95 102 103 106 107 115 116 120 121 129 130 138 139 142 143 147 148 151 152 157 158 162 163 165 165 166
that system is fixed .
0 4 5 11 12 14 15 20 20 21
the computer itself was fast , ran smoothly , and had no problems .
0 3 4 12 13 19 20 23 24 28 28 29 30 33 34 42 42 43 44 47 48 51 52 54 55 63 63 64
one of the smartest thing i did was take my time to compare laptops before making my purchase .
0 3 4 6 7 10 11 19 20 25 26 27 28 31 32 35 36 40 41 43 44 48 49 51 52 59 60 67 68 74 75 81 82 84 85 93 93 94
like the price and operation .
0 4 5 8 9 14 15 18 19 28 28 29
the brand is tarnished in my heart .
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 22 23 25 26 28 29 34 34 35
this is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components , and i 'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator , but i still expected better product quality for this price range .

honestly , this is absolutely wonderful .
0 8 8 9 10 14 15 17 18 28 29 38 38 39
i ` have had it for about a 1 1/2 and yes i have had an issue with it one month out of warranty .
0 1 2 3 3 7 8 11 12 14 15 18 19 24 25 26 27 32 33 36 37 40 41 42 43 47 48 51 52 54 55 60 61 65 66 68 69 72 73 78 79 82 83 85 86 94 94 95

0 1 2 8 9 13 14 15 16 19 20 24 25 29 30 35 36 39 39 40
well , maybe i was just very unlucky .
0 4 4 5 6 11 12 13 14 17 18 22 23 27 28 35 35 36
for example , when my husband turns the light out while i 'm on the computer .
0 3 4 11 11 12 13 17 18 20 21 28 29 34 35 38 39 44 45 48 49 54 55 56 56 58 59 61 62 65 66 74 74 75
once open , the leading edge is razor sharp .
0 4 5 9 9 10 11 14 15 22 23 27 28 30 31 36 37 42 42 43
loaded with bloatware .
0 6 7 11 12 21 21 22
if you buy , pray you dont have major prolems .
0 2 3 6 7 10 10 11 12 16 17 20 21 25 26 30 31 36 37 44 44 45
do n't get me wrong , i am no microsoft hater , i 've just managed to turn into a much bigger apple fan because of this machine .

hp refused to give me a new one and wal mart refused to take it back .

i loaded windows 7 via bootcamp and it works flawlessly !
0 1 2 8 9 16 17 18 19 22 23 31 32 35 36 38 39 44 45 55 55 56
i have never had to shut down the computer unexpectedly and the computer has never froze on me .
0 1 2 6 7 12 13 16 17 19 20 24 25 29 30 33 34 42 43 55 56 59 60 63 64 72 73 76 77 82 83 88 89 91 92 94 94 95
great laptop for the price , works well with action pack games .
0 5 6 12 13 16 17 20 21 26 26 27 28 33 34 38 39 43 44 50 51 55 56 61 61 62
although the price is higher then dell laptops , the macbooks are worth the dough .
0 8 9 12 13 18 19 21 22 28 29 33 34 38 39 46 46 47 48 51 52 60 61 64 65 70 71 74 75 80 80 81
recommended to people as their first laptop .
0 11 12 14 15 21 22 24 25 30 31 36 37 43 43 44
i would recomend this acer to parents and grandparents it can really help them in school .
0 1 2 7 8 16 17 21 22 26 27 29 30 37 38 41 42 54 55 57 58 61 62 68 69 73 74 78 79 81 82 88 88 89
i would not recommend this to anyone wanting a notebook expecting the performance of a desktop it does not meet the expectations .
0 1 2 7 8 11 12 21 22 26 27 29 30 36 37 44 45 46 47 55 56 65 66 69 70 81 82 84 85 86 87 94 95 97 98 102 103 106 107 111 112 115 116 128 128 129
the macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box , all the functions works great .
0 3 4 11 12 19 20 22 23 24 25 29 30 34 35 42 43 46 47 53 54 56 57 60 61 64 64 65 66 69 70 73 74 83 84 89 90 95 95 96
so what if the laptops/mobile phones look chic and cool ? the after sales support is terrible .
0 2 3 7 8 10 11 14 15 29 30 36 37 41 42 46 47 50 51 55 55 56 57 60 61 66 67 72 73 80 81 83 84 92 92 93
they have not sent a new one nor called .
0 4 5 9 10 13 14 18 19 20 21 24 25 28 29 32 33 39 39 40
i would easly reccomend this laptop to a friend .
0 1 2 7 8 13 14 23 24 28 29 35 36 38 39 40 41 47 47 48
i hate the display screen and i have done everything i could do the change it .
0 1 2 6 7 10 11 18 19 25 26 29 30 31 32 36 37 41 42 52 53 54 55 60 61 63 64 67 68 74 75 77 77 78
i spent alot of money on this product and its been a nightmare .
0 1 2 7 8 12 13 15 16 21 22 24 25 29 30 37 38 41 42 45 46 50 51 52 53 62 62 63
i also like the acer arcade but these were reallythe only two things i liked about this laptop .
0 1 2 6 7 11 12 15 16 20 21 27 28 31 32 37 38 42 43 52 53 57 58 61 62 68 69 70 71 76 77 82 83 87 88 94 94 95
have not yet needed any customer support with this yet so to me that is a great thing , which is leaps and bounds ahead of pc in my opinion .
0 4 5 8 9 12 13 19 20 23 24 32 33 40 41 45 46 50 51 54 55 57 58 60 61 63 64 68 69 71 72 73 74 79 80 85 85 86 87 92 93 95 96 101 102 105 106 112 113 118 119 121 122 124 125 127 128 130 131 138 138 139
thinking about returning it
0 8 9 14 15 24 25 27
i gave it to my daughter because i just hated the screen , hated that it had no cd drive to at least play cd 's when i wanted to listen to music and do schoolwork .
0 1 2 6 7 9 10 12 13 15 16 24 25 32 33 34 35 39 40 45 46 49 50 56 56 57 58 63 64 68 69 71 72 75 76 78 79 81 82 87 88 90 91 93 94 99 100 104 105 107 107 109 110 114 115 116 117 123 124 126 127 133 134 136 137 142 143 146 147 149 150 160 160 161
it runs very quiet too which is a plus .
0 2 3 7 8 12 13 18 19 22 23 28 29 31 32 33 34 38 38 39
but it has a major design flaw .
0 3 4 6 8 11 12 13 14 19 20 26 27 31 31 32
i took the laptop home and not even a month later , i began to have problems with it .
2 3 4 8 9 12 13 19 20 24 25 28 29 32 33 37 38 39 40 45 46 51 51 52 53 54 55 60 61 63 64 68 69 77 78 82 83 85 85 86
it was heavy , bulky , and hard to carry because of the size .
0 2 3 6 7 12 12 13 13 18 18 19 20 23 24 28 29 31 32 37 38 45 46 48 49 52 53 57 57 58

0 2 2 4 5 9 10 13 14 17 18 27 28 35 36 40 40 41

the hewitt packard pavillion dv6700 was my first laptop , before this i had a dell desktop that i loved .
2 5 6 12 13 20 21 30 31 37 38 41 42 44 45 50 51 57 57 58 59 65 66 70 71 72 73 76 77 78 79 83 84 91 92 96 97 98 99 104 104 105
apple care included .
0 5 6 10 11 19 19 20
it was an all around waste of money for me .
0 2 3 6 7 9 10 13 14 20 21 26 27 29 30 35 36 39 40 42 42 43
i worked in it retail sales before .
0 1 2 8 9 11 12 14 15 21 22 27 28 34 34 35
features like the font are very block-like and old school .
0 8 9 13 14 17 18 22 23 26 27 31 32 42 43 46 47 50 51 57 57 58
it has everything you need to get the job done .
0 2 3 6 7 17 18 21 22 26 27 29 30 33 34 37 38 41 42 46 46 47
it is loaded with programs that is of no good for the average user , that makes it run way to slow .
0 2 3 5 6 12 13 17 18 26 27 31 32 34 35 37 38 40 41 45 46 49 50 53 54 61 62 66 66 67 68 72 73 78 79 81 82 85 86 89 90 92 93 97 97 98
i feel that it was poorly put together , because once in a while different plastic pieces would come off of it .
0 1 2 6 7 11 12 14 15 18 19 25 26 29 30 38 38 39 40 47 48 52 53 55 56 57 58 63 64 73 74 81 82 88 89 94 95 99 100 103 104 106 107 109 109 110
it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once .
0 2 3 7 8 15 16 20 21 25 26 30 31 33 34 42 43 47 48 50 51 55 55 56
finally , i should note that i took the 2gb ram stick from my old eeepc and installed it before i even powered on for the first time .

this laptop has left me with a horrible taste in my mouth for acer brand products .
0 4 5 11 12 15 16 20 21 23 24 28 29 30 31 39 40 45 46 48 49 51 52 57 58 61 62 66 67 72 73 81 81 82
its not bad just very very annoying .
0 3 4 7 8 11 12 16 17 21 22 26 27 35 35 36
well , maybe more like week one .
0 4 4 5 6 11 12 16 17 21 22 26 27 30 30 31
windows is also rather unsteady on its feet and is susceptible to many bugs .
0 7 8 10 11 15 16 22 23 31 32 34 35 38 39 43 44 47 48 50 51 62 63 65 66 70 71 75 75 76
after sending out documents via email and having recipients tell me they could not open the documents or they came through as gibberish , i broke down and spent another $ 100 to get microsoft word for mac .
0 5 6 13 14 17 18 27 28 31 32 37 38 41 42 48 49 59 60 64 65 67 68 72 73 78 79 82 83 87 88 91 92 101 102 104 105 109 110 114 115 122 123 125 126 135 135 136 137 138 139 144 145 149 150 153 154 159 160 167 168 169 169 172 173 175 176 179 180 189 190 194 195 198 199 202 202 203
i believe i purchased this in dec 09 for my primary work laptop which is used 5-10 hours a day , 4-6 days a week .
0 1 2 9 10 11 12 21 22 26 27 29 30 33 34 36 37 40 41 43 44 51 52 56 57 63 64 69 70 72 73 77 78 82 83 88 89 90 91 94 94 95 96 99 100 104 105 106 107 111 111 112
do not buy gateway computers they are junk and the warranty company is horrible .
0 2 3 6 7 10 11 18 19 28 29 33 34 37 38 42 43 46 47 50 51 59 60 67 68 70 71 79 79 80
then on top of it all their cusromer service center is in the middle east .
0 4 5 7 8 11 12 14 15 17 18 21 22 27 28 36 37 44 45 51 52 54 55 57 58 61 62 68 69 73 73 74
the only bad part is the size/weight .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 17 18 20 21 24 25 36 36 37
the little battery that it did have would only last about an hour while just having it on the desktop .
0 3 4 10 11 18 19 23 24 26 27 30 31 35 36 41 42 46 47 51 52 57 58 60 61 65 66 71 72 76 77 83 84 86 87 89 90 93 94 101 101 102
i liked the aluminum body .
0 1 2 7 8 11 12 20 21 25 25 26
also it is light weight compared to others .
0 4 5 7 8 10 11 16 17 23 24 32 33 35 36 42 42 43
its good for playing my apps on facebook or watching movies .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 20 21 23 24 28 29 31 32 40 41 43 44 52 53 59 59 60
from the build quality to the performance , everything about it has been sub-par from what i would have expected from apple .
0 4 5 8 9 14 15 22 23 25 26 29 30 41 41 42 43 53 54 59 60 62 63 66 67 71 72 79 80 84 85 89 90 91 92 97 98 102 103 111 112 116 117 122 122 123
i love the dock where i can simply drop a file ontop of a particular program , and the program will simply open that file .
0 1 2 6 7 10 11 15 16 21 22 23 24 27 28 34 35 39 40 41 42 46 47 52 53 55 56 57 58 68 69 76 76 77 78 81 82 85 86 93 94 98 99 105 106 110 111 115 116 120 120 121
sorry , newegg .
0 5 5 6 7 13 13 14

0 2 3 7 8 11 12 13 14 18 18 19
pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were .
0 6 7 11 12 22 23 27 28 33 34 37 38 46 47 49 50 54 55 57 58 62 63 68 69 76 77 80 81 83 84 86 87 91 91 92
originally bought it for my wife .
0 10 11 17 18 20 21 24 25 27 28 32 32 33
it was truly a great computer costing less than one thousand bucks before tax .
0 2 3 6 7 12 13 14 15 20 21 29 30 37 38 42 43 47 48 51 52 60 61 66 67 73 74 77 77 78
waiting for the i7 was well worth it , great value for the price .
0 7 8 11 12 15 16 18 19 22 23 27 28 33 34 36 36 37 38 43 44 49 50 53 54 57 58 63 63 64

i asked how they would determine that since there are no scratches , dents or other signs of damage and was told that was the only way this type of damage could happen .
0 1 3 8 9 12 13 17 18 23 24 33 34 38 39 44 45 50 51 54 55 57 58 67 67 68 69 74 76 78 79 84 85 90 91 93 94 100 101 104 105 108 109 113 114 118 119 122 123 126 127 131 132 135 136 140 141 145 146 148 150 156 157 162 163 169 169 170

also , the extended warranty was a problem .
0 4 4 5 6 9 10 18 19 27 28 31 32 33 34 41 41 42
boots up fast and runs great !
0 5 6 8 9 13 14 17 18 22 23 28 28 29

i needed a driver for my hp and they would not help me with out me paying over $ 50 for it .
0 1 2 8 9 10 11 17 18 21 22 24 25 27 28 31 32 36 37 42 43 46 47 51 52 54 55 59 60 63 64 66 67 73 74 78 79 80 80 82 83 86 87 89 89 90

just a month and a half or two months ago , my vaio crashed again .
0 4 5 6 7 12 13 16 17 18 19 23 24 26 27 30 31 37 38 41 41 42 43 45 46 50 51 58 59 64 64 65
they sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still did n't work .
0 4 5 9 10 12 13 17 18 22 23 24 25 29 30 35 36 38 39 41 42 45 46 48 49 54 55 58 58 61 62 66 66 67

0 1 2 5 6 13 14 16 17 20 21 26 27 30 31 38 39 40 41 43 43 44

i should have spent an extra hundred bucks and got a full sized computer .
0 1 2 8 9 13 14 19 20 22 23 28 29 36 37 42 43 46 47 50 51 52 53 57 58 63 64 72 72 73

i have full control at all times of what is going on - there is no control + alt + delete business anymore .

i bought this laptop because of the performance to price ratio .

after having two pc laptops die with in the past 3 years , i was led to the apple display at best buy by the sleek design and promise of less tech issues .

this is my second macbook .
0 4 5 7 8 10 11 17 18 25 25 26
the size is perfect and i do not recomend anything bigger except for any person who can exceed the limited space it gives you .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 19 20 23 24 25 26 28 29 32 33 41 42 50 51 57 58 64 65 68 69 72 73 79 80 83 84 87 88 94 95 98 99 106 107 112 113 115 116 121 122 125 125 126
the service i received from toshiba went above and beyond the call of duty .

have had many higher priced computers crash and burn long before ever got to use all that great memory and speed , etc. .

i would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about .

reason why ? it 's because when you buy it , you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that laptop , the price will stay the same for the next year , and even if apple does decides to change mode , your laptop value will only drop 10-20 % , unlike pc laptops which drop more than 80 % .

it is extremely user friendly and intuitive .

the 17 inch screen is very large , but the computer is very light .
0 3 4 6 7 11 12 18 19 21 22 26 27 32 32 33 34 37 38 41 42 50 51 53 54 58 59 64 64 65
my opinion of sony has been dropping as fast as the stock market , given their horrible support , but this machine just caused another plunge .
2 4 5 12 13 15 16 20 21 24 25 29 30 38 39 41 42 46 47 49 50 53 54 59 60 66 66 67 68 73 74 79 80 88 89 96 96 97 98 101 102 106 107 114 115 119 120 126 127 134 135 141 141 142
do i like the computer ? well , other than not getting viruses , i guess it is ok .
0 2 3 4 5 9 10 13 14 22 22 23 24 28 28 29 30 35 36 40 41 44 45 52 53 60 60 61 62 63 64 69 70 72 73 75 76 78 78 79
for the bluetooth to work properly , you must install the launch manager on the drivers/applications dvd , or it will not show after the reload .
0 3 4 7 8 17 18 20 21 25 26 34 34 35 36 39 40 44 45 52 53 56 57 63 64 71 72 74 75 78 79 99 100 103 103 104 105 107 108 110 111 115 116 119 120 124 125 130 131 134 135 141 141 142
i waited and waited and no laptop .
0 1 2 8 9 12 13 19 20 23 24 26 27 33 33 34
everything is falling apart internally and externally .
0 10 11 13 14 21 22 27 28 38 39 42 43 53 53 54
i also liked the glass screen .
0 1 2 6 7 12 13 16 17 22 23 29 29 30
the switchable graphic card is pretty sweet when you want gaming on the laptop .
0 3 4 14 15 22 23 27 28 30 31 37 38 43 44 48 49 52 53 57 58 64 65 67 68 71 72 78 78 79
it super shiny , so you can see the fingerprints easily .
0 2 3 8 9 14 14 15 16 18 19 22 23 26 27 30 31 34 35 47 48 54 54 55
it 's not a wear-and-tear issue , not due to user carelessness and most importantly , they ca n't guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service and i have to accept the outcome .
0 2 2 4 5 8 9 10 11 24 25 30 30 31 32 35 36 39 40 42 43 47 48 60 61 64 65 69 70 81 81 82 83 87 88 90 90 93 94 103 104 107 108 115 116 120 121 123 124 130 131 133 134 136 137 139 140 144 145 148 149 156 157 160 161 162 163 167 168 170 171 177 178 181 182 189 189 190
the battery life has not decreased since i bought it , so i 'm thrilled with that .
0 3 4 11 12 16 17 20 21 24 25 34 35 40 41 42 43 49 50 52 52 53 54 56 57 58 58 60 61 69 70 74 75 79 79 80
its a dog plain and simple .

when i called toshiba , they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $ 35 for the phone call , even though they did n't offer any technical support .

my hp is very heavy .

oh and if thats not bad enough it does n't come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $ 25 for two cds .
0 2 3 6 7 9 10 15 16 19 20 23 24 30 31 33 34 38 38 41 42 46 47 51 52 53 54 62 63 65 66 68 69 72 73 76 77 81 82 85 86 88 89 92 93 97 98 101 102 104 105 107 108 111 112 115 116 118 119 122 123 126 127 129 130 133 134 138 139 141 142 143 143 145 146 149 150 153 154 157 157 158

i took the computer back in yet again except this time they kept it to send into their geek squad headquarters .
2 3 4 8 9 12 13 21 22 26 27 29 30 33 34 39 40 46 47 51 52 56 57 61 62 66 67 69 70 72 73 77 78 82 83 88 89 93 94 99 100 112 112 113

a great computer for light home use and business use .
0 1 2 7 8 16 17 20 21 26 27 31 32 35 36 39 40 48 49 52 52 53
bought it to use mostly for oline classes .
0 6 7 9 10 12 13 16 17 23 24 27 28 33 34 41 41 42
even with virus protection , it always turned off when updates were needed and installed .
0 4 5 9 10 15 16 26 26 27 28 30 31 37 38 44 45 48 49 53 54 61 62 66 67 73 74 77 78 87 87 88

0 4 5 13 14 17 18 20 21 27 28 32 33 36 37 40 41 46 47 55 55 56 57 61 62 65 66 70 71 75 76 79 80 86 86 87
they are wonderful , but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat .
0 4 5 8 9 18 18 19 20 23 24 28 29 38 39 43 44 46 47 52 53 55 56 64 65 69 69 70
this computer was awful !

0 4 4 5 6 8 9 10 11 14 15 21 22 23 24 29 29 30 31 32 33 38 39 42 43 45 46 48 49 50 51 55 56 59 60 67 67 68
even so , i like playing online games , so it was wonderful that there is a feature where i can dualboot windows .
0 4 5 7 7 8 9 10 11 15 16 23 24 30 31 36 36 37 38 40 41 43 44 47 48 57 58 62 63 68 69 71 72 73 74 81 82 87 88 89 90 93 94 102 103 110 110 111
the battery life is amazingly long at 7hrs and 5hrs if you use it .
0 3 4 11 12 16 17 19 20 29 30 34 35 37 38 42 43 46 47 51 52 54 55 58 59 62 63 65 65 66
my previous purchases were with dell and hp .
0 2 3 11 12 21 22 26 27 31 32 36 37 40 41 43 43 44
i have not have any problems .
0 1 2 6 7 10 11 15 16 19 20 28 28 29

me and my boyfriend bought the gateway nv78 in nov of 09 .
0 2 3 6 7 9 10 19 20 26 27 30 31 38 39 43 44 46 47 50 51 53 54 56 56 57
it is very user friendly and not hard to figure out at all .
0 2 3 5 6 10 11 15 16 24 25 28 29 32 33 37 38 40 41 47 48 51 52 54 55 58 58 59

the price is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop .
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 20 21 28 29 38 39 43 44 48 49 51 52 60 61 65 66 72 72 73
the nortons virus scan is only for a very short time unlike others that usually are good for a year .
0 3 4 11 12 17 18 22 23 25 26 30 31 34 35 36 37 41 42 47 48 52 53 59 60 66 67 71 72 79 80 83 84 88 89 92 93 94 95 99 99 100
it is stamped and not in pieces therefore it is a stronger more resilient frame .
0 2 3 5 6 13 14 17 18 21 22 24 25 31 32 41 42 44 45 47 48 49 50 58 59 63 64 73 74 79 79 80
i am first time mac buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use the mac offers .

two , owning a 17 in.mac book gives the flexibility to sit anywhere you want without worry about bother anyone .
0 3 3 4 5 11 12 13 14 16 17 23 24 28 29 34 35 38 39 50 51 53 54 57 58 66 67 70 71 75 76 83 84 89 90 95 96 102 103 109 109 110

0 4 5 9 10 14 15 18 19 21 21 23 24 28 29 32 33 39 39 40
came fully loaded - good .
0 4 5 10 11 17 18 19 20 24 24 25
i noticed windows has a new system called windows 7 , what about us vista users ? they should get all the bugs out of vista before investing in a new system .
0 1 2 9 10 17 18 21 22 23 24 27 28 34 35 41 42 49 50 51 51 52 53 57 58 63 64 66 67 72 73 78 78 79 81 85 86 92 93 96 97 100 101 104 105 109 110 113 114 116 117 122 123 129 130 139 140 142 143 144 145 148 149 155 155 156
when we bought our new hp comouter in dec. of 2008 , we wanted windows xp , but were told it would cost an extra $ 159 , so we went with vista .
0 4 5 7 8 14 15 18 19 22 23 25 26 34 35 37 38 42 43 45 46 50 50 51 52 54 55 61 62 69 70 72 72 73 74 77 78 82 83 87 88 90 91 96 97 101 102 104 105 110 111 112 112 115 115 116 117 119 120 122 123 127 128 132 133 138 138 139
-lrb- i definatly ca n't -rrb- .
0 1 1 2 3 12 13 15 15 18 18 19 19 20
files as well would become lost , deleted or corrupted .
0 5 6 8 9 13 14 19 20 26 27 31 31 32 33 40 41 43 44 53 53 54
it is meant to be portable .
0 2 3 5 6 11 12 14 15 17 18 26 26 27
my laptop worked again for just a while before i started having issues again .
0 2 3 9 10 16 17 22 23 26 27 31 32 33 34 39 40 46 47 48 49 56 57 63 64 70 71 76 76 77
this is perfect for her field .
0 4 5 7 8 15 16 19 20 23 24 29 29 30
taking it back less than 24 hours of purchase
0 6 7 9 10 14 15 19 20 24 25 27 28 33 34 36 37 45
that 's the downside for me .
0 4 4 6 7 10 11 19 20 23 24 26 26 27
the only thing that i have , is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters , would help if it was a little lighter then it is .
0 3 4 8 9 14 15 19 20 21 22 26 26 27 28 30 31 34 35 38 39 44 45 47 48 49 50 56 57 61 62 64 65 68 69 72 73 80 80 81 82 87 88 92 93 95 96 98 99 102 103 104 105 111 112 119 120 124 125 127 128 130 130 131
hopefully amazon will take this back .
0 9 10 16 17 21 22 26 27 31 32 36 36 37
they ended up keeping my computer for almost 3 months !

i 'm still within the one year warranty but the repair `` depot '' has deemed that this time it was caused by physical abuse and is not covered .
0 1 1 3 4 9 10 16 17 20 21 24 25 29 30 38 39 42 43 46 47 53 54 55 55 60 60 61 63 66 67 73 74 78 79 83 84 88 89 91 92 95 96 102 103 105 106 114 115 120 121 124 125 127 128 131 133 140 140 141
but i needed a laptop for school use .
2 5 6 7 8 14 15 16 17 23 24 27 28 34 35 38 38 39
he ca n't stand it .
0 2 3 5 5 8 9 14 15 17 17 18
the computer was delivered as promised .
0 3 4 12 13 16 17 26 27 29 30 38 38 39
this is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design .
0 4 5 7 8 11 12 20 21 29 30 32 33 35 36 45 46 52 52 53
i would like at least a 4 hr . battery life .
0 1 2 7 8 12 13 15 16 21 22 23 24 25 26 28 28 29 30 37 38 42 42 43
the only thing that i do n't like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that i want to be able to run and i am not able to .
0 3 4 8 9 14 15 19 20 21 22 24 24 27 28 32 33 38 39 41 42 45 46 48 49 53 54 63 64 69 70 73 74 82 83 87 88 89 90 94 95 97 98 100 101 105 106 108 109 112 113 116 117 118 119 121 122 125 126 130 131 133 133 134
looking online , many people are having the same problem .
0 7 8 14 14 15 16 20 21 27 28 31 32 38 39 42 43 47 48 55 55 56
wireless has not been a issue for me , like some others have meantioned .
0 8 9 12 13 16 17 21 22 23 24 29 30 33 34 36 36 37 38 42 43 47 48 54 55 59 60 70 70 71
this is my second mac book pro .
0 4 5 7 8 10 11 17 18 21 22 26 27 30 30 31
macbook notebooks quickly die out because of their short battery life , as well as the many background programs that run without the user 's knowlede .
0 7 8 17 18 25 26 29 30 33 34 41 42 44 45 50 51 56 57 64 65 69 69 70 71 73 74 78 79 81 82 85 86 90 91 101 102 110 111 115 116 119 120 127 128 131 132 136 136 138 139 147 147 148
all the things you can do with the trackpad make navigating around the computer and its programs so much simpler , quicker , and easier .
0 3 4 7 8 14 15 18 19 22 23 25 26 30 31 34 35 43 44 48 49 59 60 66 67 70 71 79 80 83 84 87 88 96 97 99 100 104 105 112 112 113 114 121 121 122 123 126 127 133 133 134
i guess the only good thing that came out of these were the speakers and the subwoofer .
0 1 2 7 8 11 12 16 17 21 22 27 28 32 33 37 38 41 42 44 45 50 51 55 56 59 60 68 69 72 73 76 77 86 86 87

all for such a great price .
0 3 4 7 8 12 13 14 15 20 21 26 26 27
i went right out and purchased another laptop .
0 1 2 6 7 12 13 16 17 20 21 30 31 38 39 45 45 46
long story short , since i experience so many problems with my laptop every since i bought it from day one , i did n't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what i pay for a crapy laptop , but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year , they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services , they finally gave in .
2 6 7 12 13 18 18 19 20 25 26 27 28 38 39 41 42 46 47 55 56 60 61 63 64 70 71 76 77 82 83 84 85 91 92 94 95 99 100 103 104 107 107 108 109 110 111 114 114 117 118 121 122 125 126 127 128 131 132 138 139 141 142 143 144 150 151 153 154 158 159 160 161 164 165 168 169 170 171 176 177 183 183 184 185 188 189 193 194 196 197 206 207 209 210 212 213 219 220 228 229 232 233 240 241 245 245 246 247 251 252 256 257 258 259 262 263 267 268 270 271 274 275 279 280 283 284 289 290 292 293 297 298 303 304 307 308 318 319 324 325 330 331 339 340 343 344 352 352 353 354 358 359 366 367 371 372 374 374 375
i am able to play 720p and 1080p media files just fine with it .
0 1 2 4 5 9 10 12 13 17 18 22 23 26 27 32 33 38 39 44 45 49 50 54 55 59 60 62 62 63
i already own an iphone , and so the move just made more sense .
0 1 2 9 10 13 14 16 17 23 23 24 25 28 29 31 32 35 36 40 41 45 46 50 51 55 56 61 61 62
so think about factoring those things in when you purchase .

took the netbook on a vacation trip and i was able to do whatever i wanted to do without lugging a much heavier laptop .
0 4 5 8 9 16 17 19 20 21 22 30 31 35 36 39 40 41 42 45 46 50 51 53 54 56 57 65 66 67 68 74 75 77 78 80 81 88 89 96 97 98 99 103 104 111 112 118 118 119

this computer gets very hot , before shutting down .
0 4 5 13 14 18 19 23 24 27 27 28 29 35 36 44 45 49 49 50
another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed $ 175 to send it in to fix it .
0 7 8 13 14 16 17 21 22 27 28 32 33 34 35 40 41 44 45 49 50 55 56 59 60 65 66 69 70 72 73 79 80 81 81 84 85 87 88 92 93 95 96 98 99 101 102 105 106 108 108 109

satisfy what i paid for it .

it is trash !

clear picture on it and everything .
0 5 6 13 14 16 17 19 20 23 24 34 34 35
overall though , for the money spent it 's a great deal .
0 7 8 14 14 15 16 19 20 23 24 29 30 35 36 38 38 40 41 42 43 48 49 53 53 54
so you do n't get frustrated the first few weeks .

the reaction of toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter .

the mac version of microsoft office is cheaper than buying the actual and works just as well .
0 3 4 7 8 15 16 18 19 28 29 35 36 38 39 46 47 51 52 58 59 62 63 69 70 73 74 79 80 84 85 87 88 92 92 93
the mac takes about the same amount of starting-up time as the average pc , but keeps itself cleaned up and ready to use .
0 3 4 7 8 13 14 19 20 23 24 28 29 35 36 38 39 50 51 55 56 58 59 62 63 70 71 73 73 74 75 78 79 84 85 91 92 99 100 102 103 106 107 112 113 115 116 119 119 120
its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 21 22 23 24 31 32 34 35 36 37 40 41 45 46 51 52 59 60 64 65 71 72 78 78 79
the toshiba net book operates very well .

the touch pad is fine - again , it 's a real touch pad .
0 3 4 9 10 13 14 16 17 21 22 23 24 29 29 30 31 33 33 35 36 37 38 42 43 48 49 52 52 53
the pictures are clear as can be .
0 3 4 12 13 16 17 22 23 25 26 29 30 32 32 33
it is also very lightweight , making transporting this computer very easy .
0 2 3 5 6 10 11 15 16 27 27 28 29 35 36 48 49 53 54 62 63 67 68 72 72 73
if anything , i would only suggest using one of these laptops if only you have to .
0 2 3 11 11 12 13 14 15 20 21 25 26 33 34 39 40 43 44 46 47 52 53 60 61 63 64 68 69 72 73 77 78 80 80 81
i sit down and use my husband 's work pc and i do n't like it one bit .
0 1 2 5 6 10 11 14 15 18 19 21 22 29 29 31 32 36 37 39 40 43 44 45 46 48 48 51 52 56 57 59 60 63 64 67 67 68
it 's wonderful for computer gaming .
0 2 2 4 5 14 15 18 19 27 28 34 34 35
you have to toss out the wifi card and replace it just to have any sort of network capability .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 16 17 20 21 24 25 29 30 34 35 38 39 46 47 49 50 54 55 57 58 62 63 66 67 71 72 74 75 82 83 93 93 94
and the best part is that it even comes with a free printer -lrb- when they have a certain promotion/offer going , of course -rrb- !
0 3 4 7 8 12 13 17 18 20 21 25 26 28 29 33 34 39 40 44 45 46 47 51 52 59 60 61 61 65 66 70 71 75 76 77 78 85 86 101 102 107 107 108 109 111 112 118 118 119 119 120
the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway 4 times they would give us a new one .
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 19 20 22 23 27 28 32 33 37 38 43 44 48 49 53 54 56 57 60 61 63 64 71 72 73 74 79 80 84 85 90 91 95 96 98 99 100 101 104 105 108 108 109
it is very easy for anyone to use an apple and specially the mcbook pro notebook .
0 2 3 5 6 10 11 15 16 19 20 26 27 29 30 33 34 36 37 42 43 46 47 56 57 60 61 67 68 71 72 80 80 81

0 1 2 6 7 9 10 16 17 21 22 24 25 28 29 33 34 40 40 41
the flaws are , this computer is not for computer gamers because of the os x.
0 3 4 9 10 13 13 14 15 19 20 28 29 31 32 35 36 39 40 48 49 55 56 63 64 66 67 70 71 73 74 76
i tried giving it 0 stars but i had to choose at least one , but imo no stars
0 1 2 7 8 14 15 17 18 19 20 25 26 29 30 31 32 35 36 38 39 45 46 48 49 54 55 58 58 59 60 63 64 67 68 70 71 76
they really do have the worlds very worst repair service .
0 4 5 11 12 14 15 19 20 23 24 30 31 35 36 41 42 48 49 56 56 57
they need to stop outsoucing and send some complaint calls to us based customer service agents for those who live in the united states .
0 4 5 9 10 12 13 17 18 28 29 32 33 37 38 42 43 52 53 58 59 61 62 64 65 70 71 79 80 87 88 94 95 98 99 104 105 108 109 113 114 116 117 120 121 127 128 134 134 135
i was also able to install and use my photoshop and aftereffects programs easily .
2 3 4 7 8 12 13 17 18 20 21 28 29 32 33 36 37 39 40 49 50 53 54 66 67 75 76 82 82 83
it 's perfect for everything and runs faster than an average pc !
0 2 2 4 5 12 13 16 17 27 28 31 32 36 37 43 44 48 49 51 52 59 60 62 62 63
for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is .
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 18 19 21 22 24 25 32 33 37 38 40 41 43 44 46 47 51 52 54 55 57 58 60 60 61
heck , i like all mac computers , but they 're all way too pricey for the kind of economy the u.s. is going through .
0 4 4 5 6 7 8 12 13 16 17 20 21 30 30 31 32 35 36 40 40 43 44 47 48 51 52 55 56 62 63 66 67 70 71 75 76 78 79 86 87 90 91 95 96 98 99 104 105 112 112 113
then after paying for it to be examined i was told it was same problem cited on website but i 'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty .

they claim that i should be happy because i am getting a new laptop to replace my two-month old laptop .
0 4 5 10 11 15 16 17 18 24 25 27 28 33 34 41 42 43 44 46 47 54 55 56 57 60 61 67 68 70 71 78 79 81 82 91 92 95 96 102 102 103
i 'm already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop has shown .
0 1 1 3 4 11 12 18 19 21 22 25 26 31 32 36 37 40 41 54 55 59 60 64 65 71 72 75 76 81 81 82
the machine itself is alright .
0 3 4 11 12 18 19 21 22 29 29 30
it seems to have some opions that are intalled but do not work like i thought they would .
0 2 3 8 9 11 12 16 17 21 22 28 29 33 34 37 38 46 47 50 51 53 54 57 58 62 63 67 68 69 70 77 78 82 83 88 88 89
and having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare .
0 3 4 10 11 13 14 18 19 23 24 27 28 35 36 39 40 44 45 46 47 51 52 57 58 67 67 68
i will definitely be getting a new laptop if it has any more issues after the warranty expires and researching carefully when i do so i do n't run accross a situation like this again !
2 3 4 8 9 19 20 22 23 30 31 32 33 36 37 43 44 46 47 49 50 53 54 57 58 62 63 69 70 75 76 79 80 88 89 96 97 100 101 112 113 122 123 127 128 129 130 132 133 135 136 137 138 140 140 143 144 147 148 155 156 157 158 167 168 172 173 177 178 183 183 184

0 1 2 6 7 17 18 21 22 26 27 31 32 34 35 42 43 46 46 47
it has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer .
0 2 3 6 7 10 11 14 15 23 24 28 29 32 33 42 43 46 47 54 55 58 59 61 62 65 66 70 71 74 75 79 80 82 83 85 86 91 92 96 97 100 101 109 109 110

i did an internet search and this is a very common problem with this laptop .
0 1 2 5 6 8 9 17 18 24 25 28 29 33 34 36 37 38 39 43 44 50 51 58 59 63 64 68 70 76 76 77
i 've owned this labtop for less then two months , already the mouse button has broke .
0 1 1 4 5 10 11 15 16 22 23 26 27 31 32 36 37 40 41 47 47 48 49 56 57 60 61 66 67 73 74 77 78 83 83 84
it did fairly well , other than it 's poor performance , overheating and occational blue screen .
0 2 3 6 7 13 14 18 18 19 20 25 26 30 31 33 33 35 36 40 41 52 52 53 54 65 66 69 70 80 81 85 86 92 92 93
the touchpad is very intuitive , so much so that i never want to use buttons to click again !
0 3 4 12 13 15 16 20 21 30 30 31 32 34 35 39 40 42 43 47 48 49 50 55 56 60 61 63 64 67 68 75 76 78 79 84 85 90 90 91
tons of bloatware and junk programs .
0 4 5 7 8 17 18 21 22 26 27 35 35 36
its sad because their commercials are great .
0 3 4 7 8 15 16 21 22 33 34 37 38 43 43 44
lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small .
0 4 5 7 8 13 14 19 20 23 24 27 28 36 37 39 40 52 53 58 58 59
luckily , dell said they would replace my laptop with a new one , but instead i got a refund and bought a mac .
0 7 7 8 9 13 14 18 19 23 24 29 30 37 38 40 41 47 48 52 53 54 55 58 59 62 62 63 64 67 68 75 76 77 78 81 82 83 84 90 91 94 95 101 102 103 104 107 107 108
i decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it .
0 1 2 9 10 12 13 16 17 21 22 26 27 29 30 34 35 37 38 39 40 44 45 48 49 56 57 65 66 72 73 75 75 76
never been hacked .
0 5 6 10 11 17 17 18
it 's so bad that i 'm thinking i only got half a battery or something .
0 2 2 4 5 7 8 11 12 16 17 18 18 20 21 29 30 31 32 36 37 40 41 45 46 47 48 55 56 58 59 68 68 69
good keyboard , long battery life , largest hard drive and windows 7 .
0 4 5 13 13 14 15 19 20 27 28 32 32 33 34 41 42 46 47 52 53 56 57 64 65 66 66 67
i think it was seventy nine plus tax .
0 1 2 7 8 10 11 14 15 22 23 27 28 32 33 36 36 37
in summary , take your money elsewhere .
0 2 3 10 10 11 12 16 17 21 22 27 28 37 37 38
the processor is very quick and effective as i load webpages and applications .
0 3 4 13 14 16 17 21 22 27 28 31 32 41 42 44 45 46 47 51 52 60 61 64 65 77 77 78
my battery went bad about a year and a half after having it and it cost around eighty to a hundred dollars !
0 2 3 10 11 15 16 19 20 25 26 27 28 32 33 36 37 38 39 43 44 49 50 56 57 59 60 63 64 66 67 71 72 78 79 85 86 88 89 90 91 98 99 106 106 107
i will never buy -lrb- refurbished -rrb- again , i do n't cae how cheap it is .
0 1 2 6 7 12 13 16 17 18 18 29 29 30 31 36 36 37 38 39 40 42 42 45 46 49 50 53 54 59 60 62 63 65 65 66
it pretty much does everything we could ever need , and looks great to boot .
0 2 3 9 10 14 15 19 20 30 31 33 34 39 40 44 45 49 49 50 51 54 55 60 61 66 67 69 70 74 74 75
it is just slow slow slow .
2 4 5 7 8 12 13 17 18 22 23 27 27 28
bottom line , i doubt you 'd be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine .
0 6 7 11 11 12 13 14 15 20 21 24 24 26 27 29 30 36 37 49 50 52 53 56 57 63 64 66 67 71 72 79 79 80
as a lifelong windows user , i was extremely pleased to make the change to mac .
0 2 3 4 5 13 14 21 22 26 26 27 28 29 30 33 34 43 44 51 52 54 55 59 60 63 64 70 71 73 74 77 77 78
so , owing to these problems , i went out and got myself an apple macbook pro , which i am using with great satisfaction at this very moment .
0 2 2 3 4 9 10 12 13 18 19 27 27 28 29 30 31 35 36 39 40 43 44 47 48 54 55 57 58 63 64 71 72 75 75 76 77 82 83 84 85 87 88 93 94 98 99 104 105 117 118 120 121 125 126 130 131 137 137 138
the macbook pro is extremely thin and light compared to those heavy windows laptop .
0 3 4 11 12 15 16 18 19 28 29 33 34 37 38 43 44 52 53 55 56 61 62 67 68 75 76 82 82 83
so this was great for me .
0 2 3 7 8 11 12 17 18 21 22 24 24 25
this is the first macbook i have ever had .
0 4 5 7 8 11 12 17 18 25 26 27 28 32 33 37 38 41 41 42
the acer one compuer is a great computer .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 20 21 23 24 25 26 31 32 40 40 41
another problem .
0 7 8 15 15 16
the macbook is also made better , my computer has never got a virus , and the laptop runs just as fast as the first day i bought it .
0 3 4 11 12 14 15 19 20 24 25 31 31 32 33 35 36 44 45 48 49 54 55 58 59 60 61 66 66 67 68 71 72 75 76 82 83 87 88 92 93 95 96 100 101 103 104 107 108 113 114 117 118 119 120 126 127 129 129 130
so , if you 're thinking of a laptop , i would heartily recommend theapple 13.3 macbook pro notebook computer -lrb- z0j80001 -rrb- notebook for all your needs !
0 2 2 3 4 6 7 10 10 13 14 22 23 25 26 27 28 34 34 35 36 37 38 43 44 52 53 62 63 71 72 76 77 84 85 88 89 97 98 106 107 108 108 116 116 117 118 126 127 130 131 134 135 139 140 145 145 146
i wiped nearly everything off of it , installed openoffice and firefox , and i am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price .
0 1 2 7 8 14 15 25 26 29 30 32 33 35 35 36 37 46 47 57 58 61 62 69 69 70 71 74 75 76 77 79 80 89 90 92 93 103 104 113 114 117 118 124 125 132 133 136 137 138 139 144 145 150 150 151
overall i feel this netbook was poor quality , had poor performance , although it did have great battery life when it did work .

i picked it out because it was inexpensive -lrb- $ 400 -rrb- and i thought it would be a good , easy to use first laptop .

my only problem is i can not reg . the product key .

the `` time remaining '' goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes .

pay attention to the specs if you want these options .
0 3 4 13 14 16 17 20 21 26 27 29 30 33 34 38 39 44 45 52 52 53
stupidly , mind-numbingly slow -- then i found it can only be loaded with 2gb * maximum * .
2 10 10 11 12 26 27 31 31 33 33 37 38 39 40 45 46 48 49 52 53 57 58 60 61 67 68 72 73 76 77 78 78 85 85 86 86 87
it also does not have bluetooth .
0 2 3 7 8 12 13 16 17 21 22 31 31 32
sure it has the one touch keys but that was the best feature of the computer .
0 4 5 7 8 11 12 15 16 19 20 25 26 30 31 34 35 39 40 43 44 47 48 52 53 60 61 63 64 67 68 76 76 77

being a pc user my whole life ...
0 5 6 7 8 10 11 15 16 18 19 24 25 29 29 33
great battery life .
0 5 6 13 14 18 18 19
the real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard and it 's speed .
0 3 4 8 9 14 15 18 19 21 22 26 27 35 36 38 39 42 43 47 48 50 51 54 55 63 64 67 68 70 70 72 73 78 78 79
at first , the computer seemed a great deal -- seemingly high-end specs for a low , low price .
0 2 3 8 8 9 10 13 14 22 23 29 30 31 32 37 38 42 42 44 44 53 54 62 63 68 69 72 73 74 75 78 78 79 80 83 84 89 89 90
delivery was early too .
0 8 9 12 13 18 19 22 22 23
during that time , i had to send it back 3 times .
0 6 7 11 12 16 16 17 18 19 20 23 24 26 27 31 32 34 35 39 40 41 42 47 47 48
although i opted for the lowest end macbook pro , this thing holds its own .
0 8 9 10 11 16 17 20 21 24 25 31 32 35 36 43 44 47 47 48 49 53 54 59 60 65 66 69 70 73 73 74

0 4 5 8 9 18 19 21 22 25 26 29 30 38 39 42 43 52 53 59 59 60
and that probably explains why i 've already had my sata controller go bad within a year of buying it .
0 3 4 8 9 17 18 26 27 30 31 32 32 35 36 43 44 47 48 50 51 55 56 66 67 69 70 73 74 80 81 82 83 87 88 90 91 97 98 100 100 101
i left the place angrily .

i my wife is also now the proud owner of a macbook as well !

i 've had a toshiba laptop in the past ;
0 1 1 4 5 8 9 10 11 18 19 25 26 28 29 32 33 37 37 38
it 's also very capable of doing moderate video editing -lrb- although you may need the performance boost of the larger macbook pros for heavy duty mobile video editing -rrb- .
0 2 2 4 5 9 10 14 15 22 23 25 26 31 32 40 41 46 47 54 55 56 56 64 65 68 69 72 73 77 78 81 82 93 94 99 100 102 103 106 107 113 114 121 122 126 127 130 131 136 137 141 142 148 149 154 155 162 162 163 163 164
asus said my net-book was working properly .
0 4 5 9 10 12 13 21 22 25 26 33 34 42 42 43
i received this laptop as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst .
0 1 2 10 11 15 16 22 23 25 26 27 28 32 33 36 37 40 41 43 44 48 49 53 54 57 58 62 63 66 67 70 71 76 76 77
very annoying .
0 4 5 13 13 14
my main reason to convert was the imovie program .
0 2 3 7 8 14 15 17 18 25 26 29 30 33 34 40 41 48 48 49
it has a faster processor and more ram .
0 2 3 6 7 8 9 15 16 25 26 29 30 34 35 38 38 39
if you need an affordable , entry-level laptop , this will fit the bill .
0 2 3 6 7 11 12 14 15 25 25 26 27 38 39 45 45 46 47 51 52 56 57 60 61 64 65 69 69 70
laptops are usually used on the go , so why not give you a better battery ?
0 7 8 11 12 19 20 24 25 27 28 31 32 34 34 35 36 38 39 42 43 46 47 51 52 55 56 57 58 64 65 72 72 73
i will never complain about the price since i believe you get what you pay for and my macbook pro was worth every dollar .
0 1 2 6 7 12 13 21 22 27 28 31 32 37 38 43 44 45 46 53 54 57 58 61 62 66 67 70 71 74 75 78 79 82 83 85 86 93 94 97 98 101 102 107 108 113 114 120 120 121
i was n't a big fan of the netbooks but this one was very well designed .
0 1 2 5 5 8 9 10 11 14 15 18 19 21 22 25 26 34 35 38 39 43 44 47 48 51 52 56 57 61 62 70 70 71
it may take a little getting used to but you do n't have to worry about viruses or other headaches .
0 2 3 6 7 11 12 13 14 20 21 28 29 33 34 36 37 40 41 44 45 47 47 50 51 55 56 58 59 64 65 70 71 78 79 81 82 87 88 97 97 98
and the warranty on this macbook pro can last up to 5 years or 1000 battery recharge cycles .

would like more trendy , high tech features .
0 5 6 10 11 15 16 22 22 23 24 28 29 33 34 42 42 43
keyboard is great but primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable .
0 8 9 11 12 17 18 21 22 29 30 33 34 43 44 51 52 59 60 65 66 68 69 73 74 81 81 82
screen is a bit glossy , but that 's not too bad .

it is so great , i can hardly ever take my hands off it !

i remind myself from time to time to take off my watch when ever i look at the small scratch that it has caused .
0 1 2 8 9 15 16 20 21 25 26 28 29 33 34 36 37 41 42 45 46 48 49 54 55 59 60 64 65 66 67 71 72 74 75 78 79 84 85 92 93 97 98 100 101 104 105 111 111 112
i got it back again and was told the motherboard had been replaced , so i was now on the second motherboard within 3 months .
0 1 2 5 6 8 9 13 14 19 20 23 24 27 28 32 33 36 37 48 49 52 53 57 58 66 66 67 68 70 71 72 73 76 77 80 81 83 84 87 88 94 95 106 107 113 114 115 116 122 122 123
but reasons we chose this apple computer .
0 3 4 11 12 14 15 20 21 25 26 31 32 40 40 41
processor - when compared to my 3 week old early 2011 edition there i barely experience any difference in performance -lrb- 2.3 ghz v/s 2.4 ghz -rrb- .
0 9 10 11 12 16 17 25 26 28 29 31 32 33 34 38 39 42 43 48 49 53 54 61 62 67 68 69 70 76 77 87 88 91 92 102 103 105 106 117 118 119 119 122 123 126 127 130 131 134 135 138 138 139 139 140
they say it could be the motherboard again , but dell

i upgraded from a 5 year old laptop and was amazed to find out that this computer is much slower then my old laptop .

2nd best computer in the world only one way this computer might become the best is that it needs to upgreade patches to make less easier for people to hack into
0 3 4 8 9 17 18 20 21 24 25 30 32 36 37 40 41 44 45 49 50 58 59 64 65 71 72 75 76 80 81 83 84 88 89 91 92 97 98 100 101 109 110 117 119 121 122 126 127 131 132 138 139 142 143 149 150 152 153 157 158 162
love the speed , especially !
0 4 5 8 9 14 14 15 16 26 26 27
it could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon 5850 would have ddr5 instead of ddr3 .
0 2 3 8 9 11 12 13 14 21 22 28 29 31 32 34 35 40 41 45 46 52 53 59 60 66 67 70 71 74 75 81 82 86 87 92 93 97 98 102 103 110 111 113 114 118 118 119
not only are the versions of these programs able to be saved , worked on and opened on both a pc and mac , the versions of these programs on a mac are graphically and functionally superior .

0 2 3 6 7 13 14 18 19 23 24 26 27 32 33 35 36 38 38 39
so far it has been five months since the last problem was fixed and i am praying it has finally stopped .
2 4 5 8 9 11 12 15 16 20 21 25 26 32 33 38 39 42 43 47 48 55 56 59 60 65 66 69 70 71 72 74 75 82 83 85 86 89 90 97 98 105 105 106
it 's outstanding too .
0 2 2 4 5 16 17 20 20 21
the speed gives you the power to work on these projects seamlessly , and multiple at a time if you sowish .

so i 'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority .

some problems can be fixed if you purchase new software , but there is no guarentee .

my real problem with it ? the statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it 's a lie .
0 2 3 7 8 15 16 20 21 23 23 24 25 28 29 38 39 41 42 43 44 48 49 56 57 61 62 64 65 68 69 73 74 78 79 91 92 94 95 97 97 99 100 101 102 105 105 106
just chill and enjoy .
0 4 5 10 11 14 15 20 20 21
the battery life is also relatively good .

it is her first laptop and she is thrilled .
0 2 3 5 6 9 10 15 16 22 23 26 27 30 31 33 34 42 42 43
i should have sent it back to them then .
0 1 2 8 9 13 14 18 19 21 22 26 27 29 30 34 35 39 39 40
i definitely suggest getting an extended warranty , you will probably need it !
2 3 4 14 15 22 23 30 31 33 34 42 43 51 51 52 53 56 57 61 62 70 71 75 76 78 78 79
if this would be your first mac purchase then i would highly suggest that you take advantage of the class that they offer to learn about the differences between mac and pc 's .

this laptop leaves alot to be desired , i have had it only 5 months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice ...

i have found it very easy to use , very imformative , wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features and programs .

i was loving this netbook because it had an amazing screen and display and was small and light , but after 1 week it stopped openning web pages for me -lrb- even after installing new browsers -rrb- then eventually it just started giving me a blue screen and crashing everytime i booted it .

i 'm pretty sure it 's not newegg 's fault but when you turn on a computer you just bought you want it to at least get to desktop .

the apple macbook pro nothing to say butprofessionally great and outstanding .

it 's also very energy efficient , running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a 60 watt lightbulb .

but it came back in even worse shape .
0 3 4 6 7 11 12 16 17 19 20 24 25 30 31 36 36 37
the only thing i would change about it is the mouse keys .

it is absolutely horrible to use , despite all its so called advanced features .
0 2 3 5 6 16 17 25 26 28 29 32 32 33 34 41 42 45 46 49 50 52 53 59 60 68 69 77 77 78
before , i reloaded with windows 7 ultimate and used only the downloaded drivers from acer 's site .
0 6 6 7 8 9 10 18 19 23 24 31 32 33 34 42 43 46 47 51 52 56 57 60 61 71 72 79 80 84 85 89 89 91 92 96 96 97

0 1 2 6 7 9 10 14 15 22 23 25 26 31 32 34 35 42 43 45 46 51 52 55 56 61 62 64 65 67 68 72 72 73
it 's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than i could ever expect from a notebook .
0 2 2 4 5 10 11 20 21 24 25 28 29 35 36 41 42 54 55 59 60 61 62 67 68 72 73 79 80 84 85 86 87 95 95 96
after that i turned to email in my next vain help to get them to acknowledge that the warranty was still valid .
0 5 6 10 11 12 13 19 20 22 23 28 29 31 32 34 35 39 40 44 45 49 50 52 53 56 57 61 62 64 65 76 77 81 82 85 86 94 95 98 99 104 105 110 110 111
so far , a great product .
0 2 3 6 6 7 8 9 10 15 16 23 23 24
he loves it and it is easy to use and well the schools start teaching the kids early about computers so it was easy for him to get started .
0 2 3 8 9 11 12 15 16 18 19 21 22 26 27 29 30 33 34 37 38 42 43 46 47 54 55 60 61 69 70 73 74 78 79 84 85 90 91 100 101 103 104 106 107 110 111 115 116 119 120 123 124 126 127 130 131 138 138 139
u can do what u want in just few seconds , even to start up your computer takes few seconds .

0 4 5 9 10 13 14 15 16 20 21 22 22 31 31 32 33 43 43 44
they have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and i 'm looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular .

now am very aprehensive about toshiba laptops .
0 3 4 6 7 11 12 23 24 29 30 37 38 45 45 46
i spent 2200 dollars on a `` top of the line laptop '' .

our apple 13.3 macbook pro notebook computer -lrb- z0j80001 -rrb- notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking .

i am constantly trying to uninstall programs , clean cookies , and delete unused files .
0 1 2 4 5 15 16 22 23 25 26 35 36 44 44 45 46 51 52 59 59 60 61 64 65 71 72 78 79 84 84 85
the dv4 boasted a faster processor , more memory , and a bigger hard drive than my old computer , plus a better quality web cam , nicer screen , and many other features .
0 3 4 7 8 15 16 17 18 24 25 34 34 35 36 40 41 47 47 48 49 52 53 54 55 61 62 66 67 72 73 77 78 80 81 84 85 93 93 94 95 99 100 101 102 108 109 116 117 120 121 124 124 125 126 131 132 138 138 139 140 143 144 148 149 154 155 163 163 164
the only downfall is the battery only last 1.5-2 .0 hrs when not plugged in .
0 3 4 8 9 17 18 20 21 24 25 32 33 37 38 42 43 48 48 50 51 54 55 59 60 63 64 71 72 74 74 75

aside from the trial software and the short battery life , lack of a webcam , its great .
0 5 6 10 11 14 15 20 21 29 30 33 34 37 38 43 44 51 52 56 56 57 58 62 63 65 66 67 68 74 74 75 76 79 80 85 85 86
as a die-hard windows enthusiast , i shunned the idea of a mac until this point .
0 2 3 4 5 13 14 21 22 32 32 33 34 35 36 43 44 47 48 52 53 55 56 57 58 61 62 67 68 72 73 78 78 79
i think that if it is the motherboard again so soon that they should replace it .
0 1 2 7 8 12 13 15 16 18 19 21 22 25 26 37 38 43 44 46 47 51 52 56 57 61 62 68 69 76 77 79 79 80

the computer loads in about a 1/10th of the time that my pc did , and i have all of the programs that were on my pc .
0 3 4 12 13 18 19 21 22 27 28 29 30 36 37 39 40 43 44 48 49 53 54 56 57 59 60 63 63 64 65 68 69 70 71 75 76 79 80 82 83 86 87 95 96 100 101 105 106 108 109 111 112 114 114 115
i made the right decision .
0 1 2 6 7 10 11 16 17 25 25 26
in the past few years , i 've had terrible experiences with hp .
0 2 3 6 7 11 12 15 16 21 21 22 23 24 24 27 28 31 32 40 41 52 53 57 58 60 60 61

the newer black keyboard took a little bit away from the previous gray one which looked really slick , but it is still a great notebook !
0 3 4 9 10 15 16 24 25 29 30 31 32 38 39 42 43 47 48 52 53 56 57 65 66 70 71 74 75 80 81 87 88 94 95 100 100 101 102 105 106 108 109 111 112 117 118 119 120 125 126 134 134 135

i am very happy !
0 1 2 4 5 9 10 15 15 16
as with any laptop not purchased with software options , it comes with a lot of what i consider useless applications .
0 2 3 7 8 11 12 18 19 22 23 32 33 37 38 46 47 54 54 55 56 58 59 64 65 69 70 71 72 75 76 78 79 83 84 85 86 94 95 102 103 115 115 116
its office compatible , but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs .
0 3 4 10 11 21 21 22 23 26 27 30 31 39 40 43 44 47 48 59 60 62 63 66 67 70 71 76 77 79 80 83 84 89 90 92 93 97 98 102 103 106 107 112 113 116 117 121 122 127 128 131 132 135 136 145 146 149 150 158 158 159

do you think i purposely `` destroy '' my netbook , so that i can demand a new set ? do you think it 's fun to take public transport all the way to the service center and get a non-satisfactory solution ? or rather no solution .

i 'm having the laptop returned unrepaired since paying $ 176 every 3 months just is n't worth it -lrb- that 's about how long the port seems to last -rrb- .

so if you move laptop a lot , it might get loose , however it sits pretty tightly .

the biggest problem is that the box had no instructions in it .
0 3 4 11 12 19 20 22 23 27 28 31 32 35 36 39 40 42 43 55 56 58 59 61 61 62
but after using it a couple of weeks , the overall operation is poor .

compared to similarly spec 'd pcs , this machine is good value , well built and works easily right out of the box .

i love my new computer !
0 1 2 6 7 9 10 13 14 22 22 23
okay , let 's just start out by saying i am in no way a computer techy .

it was a waste of money from day one !
0 2 3 6 7 8 9 14 15 17 18 23 24 28 29 32 33 36 36 37
i 'm new - just switched from years of pc frustration .

so i got another netbook which i love !
0 2 3 4 5 8 9 16 17 24 25 30 31 32 33 37 37 38
but in fact it is totally the opposite .
0 3 4 6 7 11 12 14 15 17 18 25 26 29 30 38 38 39
the display is beyond horrible .

he left me , instructions on what to do when this comes up , or that comes up ...
0 2 3 7 8 10 10 11 12 24 25 27 28 32 33 35 36 38 39 43 44 48 49 54 55 57 57 58 59 61 62 66 67 72 73 75 75 81

i started hainv problems with it within the first month .

the laptop preformed pretty well .

0 3 4 5 6 8 8 11 12 15 16 18 19 21 22 23 24 31 31 32
numerous problems over the next 3 weeks until i got the blue screen of death and had to send the pc back to hp .

i think this will happen to any new version of computer/phone released and i need to wait for the next set of updates to have all of this fixed .
0 1 2 7 8 12 13 17 18 24 25 27 28 31 32 35 36 43 44 46 47 61 62 70 71 74 75 76 77 81 82 84 85 89 90 93 94 97 98 102 103 106 107 109 110 117 118 120 121 125 126 129 130 132 133 137 138 143 143 144
this one has had the same effect .

i actually contact toshiba before i started having problem and was given run around after i supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired .

it does n't have a lot of frills , but i did n't need any , and being able to buy what i needed , and not more than i needed was very important .

the battery life sucked the juice from my laptop and when the extended life battery went out we were sol there to , so much for that warranty covering all the products we purchased .

i needed a new computer for graduate school -lrb- had never owned a laptop before -rrb- , and the only reason i did n't purchase a mac was because my school 's website strongly recommended students purchase pcs .

that 's very possible , but since they do n't make windows xp drivers for the sound card in this machine , i was stuck until windows 7 came out .

was disappointed to find out that the model had been discontinued , apparently because of known motherboard problems .

the only thing i can imagine is that sony jumped on early specifications for vista requirements from microsoft and designed it to those inadequate requirements .

after years of occasionally pulling my hair out fighting computer viruses , a good friend convinced me it was time to go the apple route .

the mouse is a little bit different than what you 're used to though - it has one big flat panel and one full bar -lrb- instead of two separate ones -rrb- to click with - but you get used to it quite quickly .

this laptop looks great on the surface : 17 '' inch screen , good price-point , nice appearance , boots up quickly , runs fast etc. .

the apple systems are over priced luxurys that ar n't worth what they are being charged for , this model 's specifications are far from being impressive and they only thing you get out of this is the apple name .

my mac laptop is fabulous in both areas .

pros : the macbook pro notebook has a large battery life and you wont have to worry to charge your laptop every five hours or so .
0 4 4 5 7 10 11 18 19 22 23 31 32 35 36 37 38 43 44 51 52 56 57 60 61 64 65 69 70 74 75 77 78 83 84 86 87 93 94 98 99 105 106 111 112 116 117 122 123 125 126 128 128 129
i highly recommend this product !
0 1 2 8 9 18 19 23 24 31 31 32
disappointing for such a lovely screen and at a reasonable price
0 13 14 17 18 22 23 24 25 31 32 38 39 42 43 45 46 47 48 58 59 64
so far , it 's an average laptop - no better , no worse than the hp i replaced .
0 2 3 6 6 7 8 10 10 12 13 15 16 23 24 30 31 32 33 35 36 42 42 43 44 46 47 52 53 57 58 61 62 64 65 66 67 75 75 76
the only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 18 19 24 25 27 28 30 31 35 36 40 41 44 45 48 49 54 55 64 65 73 73 74
good price .
0 4 5 10 10 11
the motherboard is dead !
1 4 5 16 17 19 20 24 25 26
i wanted to spend around $ 700 to $ 800 so i was directed to a nice looking hp laptop .
0 1 2 8 9 11 12 17 18 24 25 26 26 29 30 32 33 34 34 37 38 40 41 42 43 46 47 55 56 58 59 60 61 65 66 73 74 76 77 83 83 84
the speed is fine .
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 17 17 18
i was starting to boil .
0 1 2 5 6 14 15 17 18 22 22 23
hmmm - that high failure rate sure is n't reflected in the retail price .
0 4 5 6 7 11 12 16 17 24 25 29 30 34 35 37 37 40 41 50 51 53 54 57 58 64 65 70 70 71
back she goes !

it was not clear that the microsoft student edition that was loaded on the computer , was a six month trial .
0 2 3 6 7 10 11 16 17 21 22 25 26 35 36 43 44 51 52 56 57 60 61 67 68 70 71 74 75 83 83 84 85 88 89 90 91 94 95 100 101 106 106 107
not the day received .
0 3 4 7 8 11 12 20 20 21
good for every day computing and web browsing .
0 4 5 8 9 14 15 18 19 28 29 32 33 36 37 45 45 46
while lacking some of the functions of the other versions , this was very acceptable for the uses planned for this computer .
0 5 6 13 14 18 19 21 22 25 26 35 36 38 39 42 43 48 49 57 57 58 59 63 64 67 68 72 73 83 84 87 88 91 92 96 97 104 105 108 109 113 114 122 122 123
also , i have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly .
2 6 6 7 8 9 10 14 15 18 19 23 24 26 27 34 35 39 40 43 44 48 49 57 58 61 62 66 67 70 71 75 76 85 85 86
it still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there .
0 2 3 8 9 14 15 17 18 20 21 22 23 29 30 34 35 38 39 42 43 45 46 49 50 55 56 58 59 61 62 69 70 72 73 78 78 79
it is by far one of the greatest investments i have ever made .
0 2 3 5 6 8 9 12 13 16 17 19 20 23 24 32 33 44 45 46 47 51 52 56 57 61 61 62
if you are a pc user looking to convert i would highly recommend it !
0 2 3 6 7 10 11 12 13 15 16 20 21 28 29 31 32 39 40 41 42 47 48 54 55 64 65 67 67 68
excellent led monitor and well equipped .
0 9 10 13 14 21 22 25 26 30 31 39 39 40
this process continued to repeat itself until the mother board had been replaced 4 times and the hard drive replaced 3 times .
2 6 7 14 15 24 25 27 28 34 35 41 42 47 48 51 52 58 59 64 65 68 69 73 74 82 83 84 85 90 91 94 95 98 99 103 104 109 110 118 119 120 121 126 126 127
without a doubt , the * design * of this laptop is fantastic .
0 7 8 9 10 15 15 16 17 20 21 22 22 28 28 29 30 32 33 37 38 44 45 47 48 57 57 58
i could n't believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge .
0 1 2 7 7 10 11 18 19 22 23 27 28 31 32 39 40 46 47 49 50 51 52 58 59 65 65 66
i could save ten essay papers and have hardly any memory left .
0 1 2 7 8 12 13 16 17 22 23 29 30 33 34 38 39 45 46 49 50 56 57 61 61 62
i 've had my macbook pro since august 2009 .
0 1 1 4 5 8 9 11 12 19 20 23 24 29 30 36 37 41 41 42
unfortunately , the laptop i purchased was also a dell and again , i have to say i hated it .
0 13 13 14 15 18 19 25 26 27 28 37 38 41 42 46 47 48 49 53 54 57 58 63 63 64 65 66 67 71 72 74 75 78 79 80 81 86 87 89 89 90
took a while to clean it up to my specs .
0 4 5 6 7 12 13 15 16 21 22 24 25 27 28 30 31 33 34 39 39 40
they are so realistic i am just speechless .
0 4 5 8 9 11 12 21 22 23 24 26 27 31 32 42 42 43
other than that , i would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities .
0 5 6 10 11 15 15 16 17 18 19 24 25 34 35 39 40 42 43 50 51 53 54 58 59 61 62 63 64 69 70 76 77 81 82 93 94 100 101 113 113 114
this is the first time that i tried and owning a netbook although i have used 3 different laptops in the past 10 years , i find not much difference except of course for the screen size .
0 4 5 7 8 11 12 17 18 22 23 27 28 29 30 35 36 39 40 46 47 48 49 56 57 65 66 67 68 72 73 77 78 79 80 89 90 97 98 100 101 104 105 109 110 112 113 118 118 119 120 121 122 126 127 130 131 135 136 146 147 153 154 156 157 163 164 167 168 171 172 178 179 183 183 184
but the biggest pain is that tech support is not available 24/7 .
0 3 4 7 8 15 16 20 21 23 24 28 29 33 34 41 42 44 45 48 49 58 59 63 63 64
there are differences that you need to know and take time to learn .
0 5 6 9 10 21 22 26 27 30 31 35 36 38 39 43 44 47 48 52 53 57 58 60 61 66 66 67
they have more problems then a 1980 's computer .
0 4 5 9 10 14 15 23 24 28 29 30 31 35 35 37 38 46 46 47
it is amazing .
0 2 3 5 6 13 13 14
needless to say , not to happy with the product .
0 8 9 11 12 15 15 16 17 20 21 23 24 29 30 34 35 38 39 46 46 47
the cool thing about this is anyone can use it .
0 3 4 8 9 14 15 20 21 25 26 28 29 35 36 39 40 43 44 46 46 47
my first laptop was an acer that i got for christmas .
0 2 3 8 9 15 16 19 20 22 23 27 28 32 33 34 35 38 39 42 43 52 52 53
still , this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work .
0 5 5 6 7 11 12 18 19 21 22 29 30 33 34 37 38 41 42 45 46 48 49 55 56 59 60 64 64 65
the internet can be an scary place its up to you on what you do with it .
0 3 4 12 13 16 17 19 20 22 23 28 29 34 35 38 39 41 42 44 45 48 49 51 52 56 57 60 61 63 64 68 69 71 71 72

i chose the ibookg4 , a laptop that is an attractive computer with a large screen big enough to please anyone .
0 1 2 7 8 11 12 19 19 20 21 22 23 29 30 34 35 37 38 40 41 51 52 60 61 65 66 67 68 73 74 80 81 84 85 91 92 94 95 101 102 108 108 109
the most recent being that my safari internet browser is freaking out on me , but i have just been using firefox instead .
0 3 4 8 9 15 16 21 22 26 27 29 30 36 37 45 46 53 54 56 57 65 66 69 70 72 73 75 75 76 77 80 81 82 83 87 88 92 93 97 98 103 104 111 112 119 119 120
i would say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful .
0 1 2 7 9 12 13 15 16 19 20 24 25 27 28 31 32 35 36 38 39 44 45 53 54 56 57 64 64 65
everything about the mac is not only visually appealing , but very easy to use .
0 10 11 16 17 20 21 24 25 27 28 31 32 36 37 45 46 55 55 56 57 60 61 65 66 70 71 73 74 77 77 78
i know what 7 hrs of battery looks like .
0 1 2 6 7 11 12 13 14 17 18 20 21 28 29 34 35 39 39 40
the macbooks worth every penny .
0 3 4 12 13 18 19 24 25 30 30 31
i did not have to call the support line at all .
0 1 2 5 6 9 10 14 15 17 18 22 23 26 27 34 35 39 40 42 43 46 46 47
the laptop is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the windows 7 starter and not the full windows 7 .
0 3 4 10 11 13 14 25 26 28 29 32 33 40 41 47 48 52 53 55 56 59 60 63 64 71 72 73 74 81 82 85 86 89 90 93 94 98 99 106 107 108 108 109
the first problem is that the keyboard function is simply unsatisfactory .
0 3 4 9 10 17 18 20 21 25 26 29 30 38 39 47 48 50 51 57 58 72 72 73
the dvd drive randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well , which is annoying .
0 3 4 7 8 13 14 22 23 27 28 32 33 37 38 40 41 43 44 46 47 49 50 58 59 61 62 66 66 67 68 73 74 76 77 85 85 86
garageband is more for the musicians , and the laptop is equipped with a good working microphone , good enough for beginners and musicians at the intermediate level .
0 10 11 13 14 18 19 22 23 26 27 36 36 37 38 41 42 45 46 52 53 55 56 64 65 69 70 71 72 76 77 84 85 95 95 96 97 101 102 108 109 112 113 122 123 126 127 136 137 139 140 143 144 156 157 162 162 163
i dual boot with linux and that other security-prone os and it performs flawlessly .
0 1 2 6 7 11 12 16 17 22 23 26 27 31 32 37 38 52 53 55 56 59 60 62 63 71 72 82 82 83
the difference is the toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space .
0 3 4 14 15 17 18 21 22 29 30 33 34 35 36 39 40 44 45 51 52 55 56 60 61 66 67 72 72 73
but if you ca n't make your product last more than a year , you will not get my business again .
0 3 4 6 7 10 11 13 13 16 17 21 22 26 27 34 35 39 40 44 45 49 50 51 52 56 56 57 58 61 62 66 67 70 71 74 75 77 78 86 87 92 92 93
there was a little difficulty doing the migration as the firewire cable system ca n't be used with the ibook .
0 5 6 9 10 11 12 18 19 29 30 35 36 39 40 49 50 52 53 56 57 65 66 71 72 78 79 81 81 84 85 87 88 92 93 97 98 101 102 107 107 108
seems like maybe a bad shipment from toshiba .
0 5 6 10 11 16 17 18 19 22 23 31 32 36 37 44 44 45
do n't waste your money !

seriously considering a larger laptop to replace the dell

i thought it would be a simple job .
0 1 2 9 10 12 13 18 19 21 22 23 24 30 31 34 34 35
but other than that i am blown away by all the features this laptop offers .

the computer will constantly be getting hot and burning your leg unless you go through the hassle of taking off the entire back of it just to clean out the fan .

so , after apple replaced the hard drive i enjoyed another 4 months of my new computer , until it froze this morning -- completely .

the macbook starts fast , does n't crash , has a fantastic display , is small and light -lrb- i have the 13.3 '' model -rrb- , and is n't always complaining about updates , lost connections , errors , blue screens , etc. .

i actually had the hard drive replaced twice , the mother board once , the dvd drive twice , then they finally agreed to replace it , -lrb- all of this in less than 1 1/2 years !

the guy then said that if i insist on having the hinge tightened , they can do it for me but i have to accept the condition after the `` repair '' .

luckly i had a student task force able to help , or else it would have crashed within the first year .

if you 're looking for something to fly through those massive spreadsheets or play a graphics-intensive game , you 'd be better off getting a machine aimed at that segment of the market .

so you might ask , what did apple do for me ?
0 2 3 6 7 12 13 16 16 17 18 22 23 26 27 32 33 35 36 39 40 42 42 43
browsing , also , was no problem for me when i used itunes -lrb- which usually slows down my pc -rrb- .

again , decent comp for the price , and i was in need of one quickly as my other laptop died on me .
0 5 5 6 7 13 14 18 19 22 23 26 27 32 32 33 34 37 38 39 40 43 44 46 47 51 52 54 55 58 59 66 67 69 70 72 73 78 79 85 86 90 91 93 94 96 96 97
so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop .

toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another , and i am not kidding you , i called different hours of the day and you 'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again , since they make it sound like they do n't have your history list of your calls right in front of them .

quality display i was surprised with the performance and quality of this hp laptop .

the battery life also does n't keep up with the claim but still i think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack .
0 3 4 11 12 16 17 21 22 26 26 29 30 34 35 37 38 42 43 46 47 52 53 56 57 62 63 64 65 70 71 78 79 81 82 86 87 92 93 97 98 101 102 106 107 109 110 113 114 118 118 119
the internet capabilities are also very strong and picks up signals very easily .

they transfer you around to other people who do not understand what you are saying and you ca n't understand what they are saying .
0 4 5 13 14 17 18 24 25 27 28 33 34 40 41 44 45 47 48 51 52 62 63 67 68 71 72 75 76 82 83 86 87 90 91 93 93 96 97 107 108 112 113 117 118 121 122 128 128 129
speakers do n't get that loud , but good enough .
0 8 9 11 11 14 15 18 19 23 24 28 28 29 30 33 34 38 39 45 45 46
i have had it 9 months and it is already a $ 250 loss .
0 1 2 6 7 10 11 13 14 15 16 22 23 26 27 29 30 32 33 40 41 42 43 44 44 47 48 52 52 53
another great thing is the beast graphics .
0 7 8 13 14 19 20 22 23 26 27 32 33 41 41 42
i was wrong !
2 3 4 7 8 13 13 14
the ease of set up was terrific .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 15 16 18 19 22 23 31 31 32
everything i have tried has worked and i never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome .
0 10 11 12 13 17 18 23 24 27 28 34 35 38 39 40 41 46 47 51 52 54 55 60 61 64 65 69 70 77 78 83 84 87 88 95 96 98 99 101 102 109 109 110
screen is crystal clear , yes it 's small - but it 's a netbook !
0 6 7 9 10 17 18 23 23 24 25 28 29 31 31 33 34 39 40 41 42 45 46 48 48 50 51 52 53 60 60 61
so this review might be a tad bit bias .
0 2 3 7 8 14 15 20 21 23 24 25 26 29 30 33 34 38 38 39
this was around three years , maybe four years ago .
0 4 5 8 9 15 16 21 22 27 27 28 29 34 35 39 40 45 46 49 49 50
the battery life is probably an hour at best .
0 3 4 11 12 16 17 19 20 28 29 31 32 36 37 39 40 44 44 45
this is a review of windows vista system .
0 4 5 7 8 9 10 16 17 19 20 27 28 33 34 40 40 41
she said its very user friendly .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 17 18 22 23 31 31 32
kind of annoying , but i still love the laptop .
0 4 5 7 8 16 16 17 18 21 22 23 24 29 30 34 35 38 39 45 45 46
cosmetically , the only thing they changed was 2 of the function keys at the top .
0 12 12 13 14 17 18 22 23 28 29 33 34 41 42 45 46 47 48 50 51 54 55 63 64 68 69 71 72 75 76 79 79 80
i am very happy i bought this mac , well worth the extra money .
0 1 2 4 5 9 10 15 16 17 18 24 25 29 30 33 33 34 35 39 40 45 46 49 50 55 56 61 61 62
but sadly the replacement froze-up while updating the bios again and shut down and would not turn back on .
0 3 4 9 10 13 14 25 26 34 35 40 41 49 50 53 54 58 59 64 65 68 69 73 74 78 79 82 83 88 89 92 93 97 98 102 103 105 105 106
there 's literally no way to make it sing with vista .
2 7 7 9 10 19 20 22 23 26 27 29 30 34 35 37 38 42 43 47 48 53 53 54
after looking at all the pros and cons , i decided on the macbook pro .
0 5 6 13 14 16 17 20 21 24 25 29 30 33 34 38 38 39 40 41 42 49 50 52 53 56 57 64 65 68 68 69
screen size is perfect for portable use in any environment .
0 6 7 11 12 14 15 22 23 26 27 35 36 39 40 42 43 46 47 58 58 59
first , it does not have a push button to open the lid .
0 5 5 6 7 9 10 14 15 18 19 23 24 25 26 30 31 37 38 40 41 45 46 49 50 53 53 54
hope this helped !

i used to build my own desktops from the component parts , and recently my 7 year old pentium 4 with ht 1 gb ram sata desktop stopped working -lrb- this was a rock star 7 years ago -rrb- .
0 1 2 6 7 9 10 15 16 18 19 22 23 31 32 36 37 40 41 50 51 56 56 57 58 61 62 70 71 73 74 75 76 80 81 84 85 92 93 94 95 99 100 102 103 104 105 107 108 111 112 116 117 124 125 132 133 140 141 142 142 146 147 150 151 152 153 157 158 162 163 164 165 170 171 174 174 175 175 176
i now realize that my $ 900 would have been better spent on a windows laptop .
0 1 2 5 6 13 14 18 19 21 22 23 23 26 27 32 33 37 38 42 43 49 50 55 56 58 59 60 61 68 69 75 75 76

-rrb- and printing from either word processor is an adventure .

very satisfied .
0 4 5 14 14 15
do not buy it !

- estimated time to fix it : 10 working days or less .

after purchasing this thing , i find out that i need a special interface device to connect my camera , and that it can not be purchased at the store - only on line .
0 5 6 16 17 21 22 27 27 28 29 30 31 35 36 39 40 44 45 46 47 51 52 53 54 61 62 71 72 78 79 81 82 89 90 92 93 99 99 100 101 104 105 109 110 112 113 116 116 119 120 122 123 132 133 135 136 139 140 145 146 147 148 152 153 155 156 160 160 161
i had my computer custom built from sonystyle.com .
0 1 2 5 6 8 9 17 18 24 25 30 31 35 36 49 49 50
another included program that is laughable is the chess game .

it works great for general internet use , microsoft office apps , home bookkeeping , etc. .
0 2 3 8 9 14 15 18 19 26 27 35 36 39 39 40 41 50 51 57 58 62 62 63 64 68 69 80 80 81 82 85 85 86

the ati graphics card is a huge plus , definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a intel built-in card would have trouble with , such as half-life 2 or even world of warcraft .

0 1 2 11 12 16 17 23 24 25 26 32 33 36 36 37
which is great i am running vista business and scored a 5.x on the index i have never seen a windows machine have a total score in the 5 's .
0 5 6 8 9 14 15 16 17 19 20 27 28 33 34 42 43 46 47 53 54 55 56 59 60 62 63 66 67 72 73 74 75 79 80 85 86 90 91 92 93 100 101 108 109 113 114 115 116 121 122 127 128 130 131 134 135 136 136 138 138 139
returning this as soon as i get out of work
0 9 10 14 15 17 18 22 23 25 26 27 28 31 32 35 36 38 39 43
i use the computer to basically check emails , surf the web , print coupons and for my college papers .
0 1 2 5 6 9 10 18 19 21 22 31 32 37 38 44 44 45 46 50 51 54 55 58 58 59 60 65 66 73 74 77 78 81 82 84 85 92 93 99 99 100
this unit is not .
0 4 5 9 10 12 13 16 16 17
we love the size of the screen , although it is still lightweight and very easy to tote around .
0 2 3 7 8 11 12 16 17 19 20 23 24 30 30 31 32 40 41 43 44 46 47 52 53 64 65 68 69 73 74 78 79 81 82 86 87 93 93 94
they are n't worth the money , even though they are on the cheap side , laptop speaking .
0 4 5 8 8 11 12 17 18 21 22 27 27 28 29 33 34 40 41 45 46 49 50 52 53 56 57 62 63 67 67 68 69 75 76 84 84 85
either way the entire thing was just a joke , a complete rip off !
0 6 7 10 11 14 15 21 22 27 28 31 32 36 37 38 39 43 43 44 45 46 47 55 56 59 60 63 63 64
so the fact that the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault .
0 2 3 6 7 11 12 16 17 20 21 29 30 34 35 38 39 43 44 46 47 50 51 53 54 60 61 67 68 71 72 74 75 77 78 83 83 84
so glad i decided to upgrade !
0 2 3 7 8 9 10 17 18 20 21 28 28 29
i would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an easy to use , stylish , fun , awesome computer .
0 1 2 7 8 18 19 28 29 33 34 36 37 40 41 44 45 47 48 51 52 58 59 62 63 65 66 70 71 73 74 77 77 78 79 86 86 87 88 91 91 92 93 100 101 109 109 110
the battery is irreplaceable .
2 5 6 13 14 16 17 30 30 31
* if you are looking for a good laptop , this is not it !
0 1 1 3 4 7 8 11 12 19 20 23 24 25 26 30 31 37 37 38 39 43 44 46 47 50 51 53 53 54
if you want a little more custom ability , drop a few bucks and upgrade to one of the more robust versions of win 7 and grab a 2gb stick of memory to spice it all up a bit more .
0 2 3 6 7 11 12 13 14 20 21 25 26 32 33 40 40 41 42 46 47 48 49 52 53 58 59 62 63 70 71 73 74 77 78 80 81 84 85 89 90 96 97 105 106 108 109 112 113 114 115 118 119 123 124 125 126 129 130 135 136 138 139 145 146 148 149 154 155 157 158 161 162 164 165 166 167 170 171 175 175 176
it 's catatonic .
0 2 2 4 5 14 14 15
i have never really been big on downloading anything so i was n't too worried about getting a virus , plus i thought i was protected by norton .
0 1 2 6 7 12 13 19 20 24 25 28 29 31 32 43 44 52 53 55 56 57 58 61 61 64 65 68 69 76 77 82 83 90 91 92 93 98 98 99 100 104 105 106 107 114 115 116 117 120 121 130 131 133 134 140 140 141
the internet was locekd and froze every time it was trying to be used , and the command prompt would not work at all .
0 3 4 12 13 16 17 23 24 27 28 33 34 39 40 44 45 47 48 51 52 58 59 61 62 64 65 69 69 70 71 74 75 78 79 86 87 93 94 99 100 103 104 108 109 111 112 115 115 116
it 's software and speed enable it to do amazing things .
0 2 2 4 5 13 14 17 18 23 24 30 31 33 34 36 37 39 40 47 48 54 54 55
the toshiba satellite laptop is designed to fail !
0 3 4 11 12 21 22 28 29 31 33 41 43 45 46 50 51 52
he came into my house , fiddled around on the computer for a good forty minutes and got ready to leave before it was even done doing what he was doing to it .
0 2 3 7 8 12 13 15 16 21 21 22 23 30 31 37 38 40 41 44 45 53 54 57 58 59 60 64 65 70 71 78 79 82 83 86 87 92 93 95 96 101 102 108 109 111 112 115 116 120 121 125 126 131 132 136 137 139 140 143 144 149 150 152 153 155 155 156
my wireless provider confirmed my home internet is fine , and any connections i turn on should work .
0 2 3 11 12 20 21 30 31 33 34 38 39 47 48 50 51 55 55 56 57 60 61 64 65 76 77 78 79 83 84 86 87 93 94 98 98 99
could not keep up with me and finally the hard drive went out .
0 5 6 9 10 14 15 17 18 22 23 25 26 29 30 37 38 41 42 46 47 52 53 57 58 61 61 62
i could have purchased a cheap computer to do what i 'm doing now !
0 1 2 7 8 12 13 22 23 24 25 30 31 39 40 42 43 45 46 50 51 52 52 54 55 60 61 64 64 65
i am most impressed with the programming , including the iphoto .
0 1 2 4 5 9 10 19 20 24 25 28 29 40 40 41 42 51 52 55 56 62 62 63
speakers too small to be of any real use .
0 8 9 12 13 18 19 21 22 24 25 27 28 31 32 36 37 40 40 41
i upgraded it 's ram to 2gb , i am very happy with it .
0 1 2 10 11 13 13 15 16 19 20 22 23 26 26 27 28 29 30 32 33 37 38 43 44 48 49 51 51 52
this is a great computer .
0 4 5 7 8 9 10 15 16 24 24 25
i purchased a toshiba satellite m60 -lrb- with harman/kardon speakers ! -rrb- in december of 2005 .
0 1 2 11 12 13 14 21 22 31 32 35 36 37 37 41 42 55 56 64 64 65 65 66 67 69 70 78 79 81 82 86 86 87
dismantle the whole thing ? then it will not be a newly manufactured set like before .
0 9 10 13 14 19 20 25 25 26 27 31 32 34 35 39 40 43 44 46 47 48 49 54 55 67 68 71 72 76 77 83 83 84
they should have included more memory on their computers if they knew vista would run slowly .
0 4 5 11 12 16 17 25 26 30 31 37 38 40 41 46 47 56 57 59 60 64 65 69 70 75 76 81 82 85 86 92 92 93
battery life could be better but overall for the price and toshiba 's reputation for laptops it 's great !
0 7 8 12 13 18 19 21 22 28 29 32 33 40 41 44 45 48 49 54 55 58 59 66 66 68 69 79 80 83 84 91 92 94 94 96 97 102 102 103
the battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months , stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes .
0 3 4 11 12 17 18 22 23 24 25 31 32 38 39 43 44 47 48 52 53 56 57 63 64 67 68 74 74 75 76 83 84 91 92 93 94 100 101 104 105 109 110 114 115 118 119 126 126 127
it would n't fit in most 17-inch bags .
0 2 3 8 8 11 12 15 16 18 19 23 24 31 32 36 36 37
the first time it crashed was maybe going on a year and a half of having it .
0 3 4 9 10 14 15 17 18 25 26 29 30 35 36 41 42 44 45 46 47 51 52 55 56 57 58 62 63 65 66 72 73 75 75 76
after the warrenty expired the hard drive went bad and it would have cost more to fix then to replace .
2 7 8 11 12 20 21 28 29 32 33 37 38 43 44 48 49 52 53 56 57 59 60 65 66 70 71 75 76 80 81 83 84 87 88 92 93 95 96 103 103 104
i paid $ 800 for this computer from my school campus bookstore .
0 1 2 6 7 8 8 11 12 15 16 20 21 29 30 34 35 37 38 44 45 51 52 61 61 62
it is small enough to fit in one of my purses !
0 2 3 5 6 11 12 18 19 21 22 25 26 28 29 32 33 35 36 38 39 45 45 46
the windows 7 starter is , in my opinion , a great way to think about using your netbook : basics , basics , basics .
0 3 4 11 12 13 14 21 22 24 24 25 26 28 29 31 32 39 39 40 41 42 43 48 49 52 53 55 56 61 62 67 68 73 74 78 79 86 86 87 88 94 94 95 96 102 102 103 104 110 110 111
i was very worried about making the two compatible - but literally , it was so simple i was almost worried that i was doing something wrong .
0 1 2 5 6 10 11 18 19 24 25 31 32 35 36 39 40 50 50 51 52 55 56 65 65 66 67 69 70 73 74 76 77 83 84 85 86 89 90 96 97 104 105 109 110 111 112 115 116 121 122 131 132 137 137 138
note that i do n't ordinarily take the time to write a review .
0 4 5 9 10 11 12 14 14 17 18 28 29 33 34 37 38 42 43 45 46 51 52 53 54 60 60 61
the neat and organized icon list is a welcome change from cluttered and confusing desktop icons .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 22 23 27 28 32 33 35 36 37 38 45 46 52 53 57 58 67 68 71 72 81 82 89 90 95 95 96
i purchased this netbook after my original toshiba laptop crashed right after the warranty expired .
0 1 2 11 12 16 17 24 25 30 31 33 34 42 43 50 51 57 58 65 66 71 72 77 78 81 82 90 91 98 98 99
apparently well-built and gorgeous to look at , the i5 macbook pro is a winning combination of price and performance .
0 10 11 21 22 25 26 34 35 37 38 42 43 45 45 46 47 50 51 53 54 61 62 65 66 68 69 70 71 78 79 90 91 93 94 99 100 103 104 115 115 116
asus has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks , and i would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them .
0 4 5 8 9 13 14 16 17 28 29 32 33 35 36 44 45 50 51 59 59 60 61 64 65 66 67 72 73 82 83 87 88 90 91 97 98 101 102 106 107 118 119 124 125 130 131 134 135 138 139 147 148 151 152 155 156 160 160 161
the apple care has never failed me , and i expect it to be the same for this computer as well .
0 3 4 9 10 14 15 18 19 24 25 31 32 34 34 35 36 39 40 41 42 48 49 51 52 54 55 57 58 61 62 66 67 70 71 75 76 84 85 87 88 92 92 93
buyer beware .
0 5 6 12 12 13
it has served my needs quite nicely for the most part .
0 2 3 6 7 13 14 16 17 22 23 28 29 35 36 39 40 43 44 48 49 53 53 54
the toshiba laptop i am using is easier to use than most i have tried .
0 3 4 11 12 18 19 20 21 23 24 29 30 32 33 39 40 42 43 46 47 51 52 56 57 58 59 63 64 69 69 70
so i called compaq , and after being on the phone for 3 hours , i finally got a replacement which i should n't have had a problem getting since it was under warranty .
0 2 3 4 5 11 12 18 18 19 20 23 24 29 30 35 36 38 39 42 43 48 49 52 53 54 55 60 60 61 62 63 64 71 72 75 76 77 78 89 90 95 96 97 98 104 104 107 108 112 113 116 117 118 119 126 127 134 135 140 141 143 144 147 148 153 154 162 162 163
so we exchanged it for the same on and after 2 hours it did n't work .
0 2 3 5 6 15 16 18 19 22 23 26 27 31 32 34 35 38 39 44 45 46 47 52 53 55 56 59 59 62 63 67 67 68
do not buy you will be disappointed .
0 2 3 6 7 10 11 14 15 19 20 22 23 35 35 36
i just recently had to ship my laptop back to hp for repair .
0 1 2 6 7 15 16 19 20 22 23 27 28 30 31 37 38 42 43 45 46 48 49 52 53 59 59 60
i have had to take it to the geek squad guys to get it fixed because it has had viruses 3 times and i have not even had it for more then 4 months !
0 1 2 6 7 10 11 13 14 18 19 21 22 24 25 28 29 33 34 39 40 44 45 47 48 51 52 54 55 60 61 68 69 71 72 75 76 79 80 87 88 89 90 95 96 99 100 101 102 106 107 110 111 115 116 119 120 122 123 126 127 131 132 136 137 138 139 145 145 146
we do n't mind and you do n't matter .
0 2 3 5 5 8 9 13 14 17 18 21 22 24 24 27 28 34 34 35
i love the size , keyboard , the functions .
0 1 2 6 7 10 11 15 15 16 17 25 25 26 27 30 31 40 40 41
but as time went on i found it almost impossible to keep the thing on-line through wi-fi .
0 3 4 6 7 11 12 16 17 19 20 21 22 27 28 30 31 37 38 48 49 51 52 56 57 60 61 66 67 74 75 82 83 88 88 89
the mouse is way way way to sensitve .
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 16 17 20 21 24 25 27 28 36 36 37
toshiba knows there is a manufacturing defect but will not acknowledge it .
0 7 8 13 14 19 20 22 23 24 25 38 39 45 46 49 50 54 55 58 59 70 71 73 73 74
the os is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly .
0 3 4 6 7 9 10 15 16 18 19 23 24 26 27 30 31 34 35 39 40 43 44 50 51 54 55 64 65 68 69 78 79 81 82 85 86 96 96 97
also , i issued a replacement rma for a few dead pixels in the upper zone of the screen , which is noticable to me .
0 4 4 5 6 7 8 14 15 16 17 28 29 32 33 36 37 38 39 42 43 47 48 54 55 57 58 61 62 67 68 72 73 75 76 79 80 86 86 87 88 93 94 96 97 106 107 109 110 112 112 113
waited on getting this computer , but it has been a great change .

after they found no other way , they told me to courier it to them -lrb- since they do n't allow the use of the post office -rrb- at my expense , and sent me a 4 page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it would n't be covered .

they break down just as often as pcs do , and the only reason they do n't get viruses , is because no one makes viruses for them , they 're not better in any way , they are worse , try finding virus protection programs for a mac , they do n't exist .

the repairs were made quickly though i must say , however the second time they shipped it to the incorrect address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me .

the speakers are terrible and are probably the cheapest ones i have ever seen in a laptop so if your planning to listen to music i suggest you get something better .
0 3 4 12 13 16 17 25 26 29 30 33 34 42 43 46 47 55 56 60 61 62 63 67 68 72 73 77 78 80 81 82 83 89 90 92 93 95 96 100 101 109 110 112 113 119 120 122 123 128 129 130 131 138 139 142 143 146 147 156 157 163 163 164
so then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you send it back , but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened , and they tell you that it was not on their side , then you are stuck paying for the repair -lrb- the price of a new one -rrb- .

what 's really great about this product is you may have a family member who is computer illiterate and you can pretty much just let them loose on this computer without any real supervision .

the lesson learned here is : it does not pay to by this loyal to any brand , since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible , as fast as they can , and in this day and age , the customer no longer is right all the times .

sure , the initial out of pocket expense is greater , but that should not dissuade anyone from the fact that these machines run like none other on the planet , and when i factor in all the money in that i wasted on geek squad and the latest patches to de-corrupt my infested pcs , it probably comes out about even anyhow .

the best thing to do is build your own computer , but if u ca n't company 's like dell who allow you to choose the components are better and for the same price you can get a computer who compares to one of apple $ 2000 systems and if you google `` dell coupons '' you can find codes that take a signifant amount off the price .

in november my computer messed up entirely and would n't power on after intalling a windows update , i had to have my hd flashed and lost everything on it , including my school assignments and irriplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things , when this update was installed for some reason i was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installed it deleted my history .

the fact that the screen reacts to the lighting around you is an added luxury-when you are working around others in dark areas and want privacy or do n't want to bother them with bright lighting , it is very convenient to have a darker , softer lit screen .

so i called , again .
0 2 3 4 5 11 11 12 13 18 18 19
also , one of the users mentioned how the edges on the macbook is sharp , if you have money to spend on one of the incase shells , it does n't seem to be a problem .

when i turned it on , nothing .
0 4 5 6 7 13 14 16 17 19 19 20 21 28 28 29

the battery is really long .
0 3 4 11 12 14 15 21 22 26 26 27
anyway , in early july of this year , the dvd burner stopped working , and the computer stared having issues with power supply .

they freeze all the time .
0 4 5 11 12 15 16 19 20 24 24 25
this one , in my opinion , might be a lemon !

this laptop is very large and barely fits in any carrying cases .

even though i had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty .

i sent it to them to fix in perfect condition but for what was wrong with it .
0 1 2 6 7 9 10 12 13 17 18 20 21 24 25 27 28 35 36 45 46 49 50 53 54 58 59 62 63 68 69 73 74 76 76 77
it is a much more streamlined system for adding programs , using the internet , and doing other things everyone does on a computer .

my computer froze on several occasion , had buttons that randomely would fall off and even had moments when the computer would refuse to turn on at all .

this is an over-sized , 18-inch laptop .
0 4 5 7 8 10 11 21 21 22 23 30 31 37 37 38
i had to pay $ 100 for a universal charger for this cheap $ 300 laptop .
0 1 2 5 6 8 9 12 13 14 14 17 18 21 22 23 24 33 34 41 42 45 46 50 51 56 57 58 58 61 62 68 68 69
the powerpoint opened seamlessly in the apple and the mac hooked up to the projector so easily it was almost scary .

took me 11 hours , 3 trips to different fedex offices , and brutal conversations with 14 of the worse it support technicians in the world .
0 4 5 7 8 10 11 16 16 17 18 19 20 25 26 28 29 38 39 44 45 52 52 53 54 57 58 64 65 78 79 83 84 86 87 89 90 93 94 99 100 102 103 110 111 122 123 125 126 129 130 135 135 136
then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so i was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running .
0 4 5 10 11 12 13 15 16 18 19 25 26 29 30 37 38 45 46 53 54 56 57 58 59 62 63 69 70 72 73 75 76 79 80 83 84 87 88 91 92 100 101 105 106 108 109 113 114 118 119 127 128 135 135 136
one year of trying to fix the computer by myself , with help of friends , and even help from computer experts i have given up on trying to fix it .

as usual at customer service center , she asked me to hold for a moment while she went to the back-office and compare it with other same model netbooks and discussed it with her colleague -lrb- i could see them -rrb- .

the screen gets smeary and dusty very quickly and it 's very noticeable .

you ca n't even get a satellite card which is why i bought to begin with .

the battery life , before the battery completely died of course , left much to be desired .
0 3 4 11 12 16 16 17 18 24 25 28 29 36 37 47 48 52 53 55 56 62 62 63 64 68 69 73 74 76 77 79 80 87 87 88

the most amazing part to me as a pc user is the startup and shutdown times - and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing .

long story , but after many calls to various offices , i was told that no one can override the depot and that managers do n't take phone calls or e/mails .

the two of us use it regularly .

in all honesty , if someone is looking for a quality laptop and willing to pay a little more money for a normal sized laptop than a cheaper and less impressive laptop , then do not buy this computer .
0 2 3 6 7 14 14 15 16 18 19 26 27 29 30 37 38 41 42 43 44 51 52 58 59 62 63 70 71 73 74 77 78 79 80 86 87 91 92 97 98 101 102 103 104 110 111 116 117 123 124 128 129 130 131 138 139 142 143 147 148 158 159 165 165 166 167 171 172 174 175 178 179 182 183 187 188 196 196 197
everything about this computer is easy to use .

after paying over $ 1000 for this computer , it was not worth it .
