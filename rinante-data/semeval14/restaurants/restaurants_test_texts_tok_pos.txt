the sangria 's - watered down .

how pretentious and inappropriate for mj grill to claim that it provides power lunch and dinners !
0 3 4 15 16 19 20 33 34 37 38 40 41 46 47 49 50 55 56 60 61 63 64 72 73 78 79 84 85 88 89 96 96 97

one caveat : some of the curried casseroles can be a trifle harsh .

i was n't impressed and it was n't spicey ????
0 1 2 5 5 8 9 18 19 22 23 25 26 29 29 32 33 39 39 43
the food was almost always excellent .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 19 20 26 27 36 36 37
i was pleasently surprised at the taste .
0 1 2 5 6 16 17 26 27 29 30 33 34 39 39 40
a nice space , as long as it does n't get too crowded and a singleminded devotion to its chosen cuisine make mare a great choice for seafood lovers .
0 1 2 6 7 12 12 13 14 16 17 21 22 24 25 27 28 32 32 35 36 39 40 43 44 51 52 55 56 57 58 70 71 79 80 82 83 86 87 93 94 101 102 106 107 111 112 113 114 119 120 126 127 130 131 138 139 145 145 146
i never had an orange donut before so i gave it a shot .
0 1 2 7 8 11 12 14 15 21 22 27 28 34 35 37 38 39 40 44 45 47 48 49 50 54 54 55
they really provide a relaxing , laid-back atmosphere .
0 4 5 11 12 19 20 21 22 30 30 31 32 41 42 52 52 53
this particular location certainly uses substandard meats .
0 4 5 15 16 24 25 34 35 39 40 51 52 57 57 58
i stumbled upon this resteraunt on my way home from the subway .
0 1 2 10 11 15 16 20 21 31 32 34 35 37 38 41 42 46 47 51 52 55 56 62 62 63
the management was less than accomodating .
0 3 4 14 15 18 19 23 24 28 29 41 41 42
the ambience is also more laid-back and relaxed .
0 3 4 12 13 15 16 20 21 25 26 35 36 39 40 47 47 48
the teas are great and all the sweets are homemade .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 18 19 22 23 26 27 30 31 37 38 41 42 50 50 51
mojitos and the service are the best part in there
0 7 8 11 12 15 16 23 24 27 28 31 32 36 37 41 42 44 45 50
sandwiches , burgers and salads , like the lemon-dressed cobb , are classic successes .
0 10 10 11 12 19 20 23 24 30 30 31 32 36 37 40 41 54 55 59 59 60 61 64 65 72 73 82 82 83

0 3 4 9 10 12 13 17 18 23 24 27 28 32 33 37 38 42 43 46 46 47
the worst though was the taste .
0 3 4 9 10 16 17 20 21 24 25 30 30 31
they were dry , stale and pretty flavorless .
0 4 5 9 10 13 13 14 15 20 21 24 25 31 32 42 42 43
the fajita we tried was tasteless and burned and the mole sauce was way too sweet .
0 3 4 10 11 13 14 19 20 23 24 33 34 37 38 44 45 48 49 52 53 57 58 63 64 67 68 71 72 75 76 81 81 82
stay with the roasted chickens and you 'll be fine .

the atmosphere is warm , comfortable , artsy and sexy .
0 3 4 14 15 17 18 22 22 23 24 35 35 36 37 42 43 46 47 51 51 52
the food is great -lrb- big selection , reasonable prices -rrb- and the drinks are really good .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 17 18 19 19 22 23 32 32 33 34 44 45 51 51 52 53 56 57 60 61 67 68 71 72 78 79 83 83 84
the steak melted in my mouth .
0 3 4 9 10 16 17 19 20 22 23 28 28 29
the food did take a few extra minutes to come , but the cute waiters ' jokes and friendliness made up for it .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 17 18 19 20 23 24 29 30 37 38 40 41 45 45 46 47 50 51 54 55 59 60 67 67 68 69 74 75 78 79 91 92 96 97 99 100 103 104 106 106 107
most importantly , it is reasonably priced .
0 4 5 16 16 17 18 20 21 23 24 34 35 41 41 42
the selection of food is excellent -lrb- i 'm not used to having much choice at restaurants -rrb- , and the atmosphere is great .
0 3 4 13 14 16 17 21 22 24 25 34 35 36 36 37 37 39 40 43 44 48 49 51 52 58 59 63 64 70 71 73 74 85 85 86 86 87 88 91 92 95 96 106 107 109 110 115 115 116
only suggestion is that you skip the dessert , it was overpriced and fell short on taste .
0 4 5 15 16 18 19 23 24 27 28 32 33 36 37 44 44 45 46 48 49 52 53 63 64 67 68 72 73 78 79 81 82 87 87 88
food was decent , but not great .
0 4 5 8 9 15 15 16 17 20 21 24 25 30 30 31
i have no idea why this restaurant is so often overlooked .
0 1 2 6 7 9 10 14 15 18 19 23 24 34 35 37 38 40 41 46 47 57 57 58
from the moment you walk in , you feel like you 're in the perfect place .
0 4 5 8 9 15 16 19 20 24 25 27 27 28 29 32 33 37 38 42 43 46 46 49 50 52 53 56 57 64 65 70 70 71
i dont know what some people who rave about this hot dog are talking about .
0 1 2 6 7 11 12 16 17 21 22 28 29 32 33 37 38 43 44 48 49 52 53 56 57 60 61 68 69 74 74 75
it is a hidden delight complete with a quaint bar and good food .
0 2 3 5 6 7 8 14 15 22 23 31 32 36 37 38 39 45 46 49 50 53 54 58 59 63 63 64
i find that most kosher restaurants are average to good , but this has been the best i 've eaten so far .
0 1 2 6 7 11 12 16 17 23 24 35 36 39 40 47 48 50 51 55 55 56 57 60 61 65 66 69 70 74 75 78 79 83 84 85 85 88 89 94 95 97 98 101 101 102
the waiters always look angry and even ignore their high-tipping regulars .
0 3 4 11 12 18 19 23 24 29 30 33 34 38 39 45 46 51 52 64 65 73 73 74
the atmosphere is very nice , and a welcome escape from the rest of the si mall .
0 3 4 14 15 17 18 22 23 27 27 28 29 32 33 34 35 42 43 49 50 54 55 58 59 63 64 66 67 70 71 73 74 78 78 79
yes , they 're a bit more expensive then typical , but then again , so is their food .
0 3 3 4 5 9 9 12 13 14 15 18 19 23 24 33 34 38 39 46 46 47 48 51 52 56 57 62 62 63 64 66 67 69 70 75 76 80 80 81
not terrible , but not the restaurant in the reviews of 2002 .
0 3 4 12 12 13 14 17 18 21 22 25 26 36 37 39 40 43 44 51 52 54 55 59 59 60
i can say that the wraps , burgers and salads were all fresh , tasty and the mango margareta at $ 9 was well worth the money .
0 1 2 5 6 9 10 14 15 18 19 24 24 25 26 33 34 37 38 44 45 49 50 53 54 59 59 60 61 66 67 70 71 74 75 80 81 90 91 93 94 95 95 96 97 100 101 105 106 111 112 115 116 121 121 122

0 3 4 11 12 14 15 26 27 30 31 39 40 43 44 48 48 49
our waiter was friendly and it is a shame that he didnt have a supportive staff to work with .

the folding chair i was seated at was uncomfortable .
0 3 4 11 12 17 18 19 20 23 24 30 31 33 34 37 38 51 51 52
as we waited i watched 3 seperate groups of diners discuss how dissapointed they also were .
0 2 3 5 6 12 13 14 15 22 23 24 25 33 34 40 41 43 44 50 51 58 59 62 63 75 76 80 81 85 86 90 90 91

the falafal was rather over cooked and dried but the chicken was fine .

montparnasse 's desserts -- especially the silken creme brulee and paper-thin apple tart -- are good enough on their own to make the restaurant worth the trip .
0 12 12 14 15 23 23 25 25 35 36 39 40 46 47 52 53 59 60 63 64 74 75 80 81 85 85 87 87 90 91 95 96 102 103 105 106 111 112 115 116 118 119 123 124 127 128 138 139 144 145 148 149 153 153 154

i 've been a regular customer at juice generation for the last 3 months - my office moved to the film center on ninth avenue and they are on the next block .

but the meals were terrible .
0 3 4 7 8 13 14 18 19 27 27 28
my chicken was completely dried out and on the cold side and the sauce was not very flavorful .
0 2 3 10 11 14 15 25 26 31 32 35 36 39 40 42 43 46 47 51 52 56 57 60 61 64 65 70 71 74 75 78 79 83 84 93 93 94
malted milk ball gelato - have you ever in your life heard of anything so ridiculously wonderful ?

0 4 5 9 10 12 13 16 17 23 24 27 28 31 32 35 36 39 40 48 49 57 58 65 66 68 69 72 73 76 77 82 83 86 87 99 99 100
way too much money for such a terrible meal .
0 3 4 7 8 12 13 18 19 22 23 27 28 29 30 38 39 43 43 44
would not recommend anyone to go .
0 5 6 9 10 19 20 26 27 29 30 32 32 33
however , the service is absolutely horrible .
0 7 7 8 9 12 13 20 21 23 24 34 35 43 43 44
a con was the slow bar service .
0 1 2 5 6 9 10 13 14 18 19 22 23 30 30 31
dessert was also to die for !
0 7 8 11 12 16 17 19 20 23 24 27 27 28
btw , the service is very good .
0 3 3 4 5 8 9 16 17 19 20 24 25 29 30 31

it 's eaten with black vinegar and shredded ginger .
0 2 2 4 5 10 11 15 16 21 22 29 30 33 34 42 43 49 49 50
the unattractive lighting made me want to gag , the food was overpriced , there was the most awful disco pop duo performing-and my escargot looked like it might crawl off the plate .
0 3 4 16 17 25 26 30 31 33 34 38 39 41 42 45 45 46 47 50 51 55 56 59 60 70 70 71 72 77 78 81 82 85 86 90 91 96 97 102 103 106 107 110 111 125 126 128 129 137 138 144 145 149 150 152 153 158 159 164 165 168 169 172 173 178 178 179

because the waiters need severe attitue adjustments .
0 7 8 11 12 19 20 24 25 31 32 39 40 51 51 52
there are numerous shavue restaurants in la , but few out here .
0 5 6 9 10 18 19 25 26 37 38 40 41 43 43 44 45 48 49 52 53 56 57 61 61 62

the food is delicious and highly recommended .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 21 22 25 26 32 33 44 44 45
when it came time to take the order the waiter gave us a hard time , walked away then came back with a paper and pen for us to write down what we wanted ... excuse me but is n't that his job ???
0 4 5 7 8 12 13 17 18 20 21 25 26 29 30 35 36 39 40 46 47 51 52 54 55 56 57 61 62 66 66 67 68 74 75 79 80 84 85 89 90 94 95 99 100 101 102 107 108 111 112 115 116 119 120 122 123 125 126 131 132 136 137 141 142 144 145 151 151 154 154 160 161 163 164 167 168 170 170 173 174 178 179 182 183 186 186 189
one of my fav spots in the city .

all i can say is they are fantastic .
0 3 4 5 6 9 10 13 14 16 17 21 22 25 26 35 35 36
dieters stick to salads or indulge in vegetarian platters .
0 7 8 13 14 16 17 23 24 26 27 34 35 37 38 48 49 57 57 58
so for a filling and healthy meal give it a go .

i decided to try out this place after hearing about it in many magazines .
0 1 2 9 10 12 13 16 17 20 21 25 26 31 32 37 38 45 46 51 52 54 55 57 58 62 63 72 72 73

0 1 2 9 10 13 14 17 18 21 22 32 33 37 38 44 45 49 49 50
sum it : local investment bankers like it , try for yourself at least once .

0 1 2 9 10 15 16 18 19 23 24 27 28 32 33 38 39 43 43 44
we were wondering why they were there to make our dining experience miserable ?
0 2 3 7 8 17 18 21 22 26 27 31 32 37 38 40 41 45 46 49 50 56 57 67 68 77 77 78

intimate but charming interior with extremely friendly and attentive service .
0 8 9 12 13 21 22 30 31 35 36 45 46 54 55 58 59 68 69 76 76 77

0 3 4 8 9 12 13 15 16 24 25 27 28 31 32 37 38 41 42 46 47 53 53 54
siam square is fairly new to the neighborhood and i think in time will gain the recognition it deserves .
0 4 5 11 12 14 15 21 22 25 26 28 29 32 33 45 46 49 50 51 52 57 58 60 61 65 66 70 71 75 76 79 80 91 92 94 95 103 103 104

my personal favorite is nick and joe 's .
0 2 3 11 12 20 21 23 24 28 29 32 33 36 36 38 38 39
the sauce is zesty and flavorful and the crust is nice and crispy .
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 18 19 22 23 32 33 36 37 40 41 46 47 49 50 54 55 58 59 65 65 66

another great thing about glechik-everything is very cheap !
0 7 8 13 14 19 20 25 26 44 45 47 48 52 53 58 58 59
unfortunately , we chose this spot for lunch as we had done a lot of walking and ended up at the south st seaport .
0 13 13 14 15 17 18 23 24 28 29 33 34 37 38 43 44 46 47 49 50 53 54 58 59 60 61 64 65 67 68 75 76 79 80 85 86 88 89 91 92 95 96 101 102 104 105 112 112 113
but regulars know that the sandwiches are the real star here .

the skillfully chosen portuguese cheese cart paired with quality port provides the perfect iberian ending .
0 3 4 14 15 21 22 32 33 39 40 44 45 51 52 56 57 64 65 69 70 78 79 82 83 90 91 98 99 105 105 106

i would definitely come back to this restaurant .
0 1 2 7 8 18 19 23 24 28 29 31 32 36 37 47 47 48
the place just is n't ready for prime time .

the sashimi portion are big enough to appease most people , but i did n't like the fact they used artifical lobster meat .

we ended up having to just leave because we were essentially being ignored by the wait staff -- even though the rest of the restaurant was largely empty .

they have waiters on the sidewalk trying to pull you in which made us suspicious .

it took 100 years for parisi to get around to making pizza -lrb- at least i do n't think they ever made it before this year -rrb- ... but it was worth the wait .

generously garnished , organic grilled burgers are the most popular dish , but the jerusalem market-style falafel wraps and mediterranean salads -- layered with beets , goat cheese and walnuts -- are equally scrumptious .

the lack of ac and the fact that there are a million swarming bodies -lrb- although everyone is polite and no one is pushing -rrb- is a slight turn off .

i love the little pie company as much as anyone else who has written reviews , but must discourage anyone from visiting the grand central location due to their rude service from two sales people .

0 5 6 8 9 14 15 19 20 22 23 31 32 34 35 39 40 45 45 46
but make sure you have enough room on your credit card as the bill will leave a big dent in your wallet .

they bring a sauce cart up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your steak -lrb- i tried them all -rrb- .

good variety but nothing surprising .

likewise if you like really thin crust or really big slices then nick and joe 's may not be your favorite .

good cake but : it was not the best cake i 've ever had , and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked employees .
0 4 5 9 10 13 13 14 15 17 18 21 22 25 26 29 30 34 35 39 40 41 41 44 45 49 50 53 53 54 55 58 59 69 70 73 74 79 80 88 89 96 97 99 100 103 104 112 113 118 119 125 126 130 131 137 138 140 141 152 153 156 157 167 168 177 177 178

the homage to india is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer , a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce , while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated , fresh take on sweet-and-sour .

the ground chickpea soup we sampled as a starter tasted somewhat thin .

the service , however , is a peg or two below the quality of food -lrb- horrible bartenders -rrb- , and the clientele , for the most part , are rowdy , loud-mouthed commuters -lrb- this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff -rrb- getting loaded for an ac/dc concert or a knicks game .

the new menu has a few creative items , they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites -lrb- but they raised the prices -rrb- , the staff is friendly most of the time , but i must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words : no , ca n't , sorry ... , boy , they wo n't bend the rules for anyone .
