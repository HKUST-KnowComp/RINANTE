our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken -lrb- usually the waiters are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meats -rrb- .

they did not have mayonnaise , forgot our toast , left out ingredients -lrb- ie cheese in an omelet -rrb- , below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it .

service is highly refined : our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress .

food is usually very good , though ocasionally i wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders .

what more can you ask for ?
0 4 5 9 10 13 14 17 18 21 22 25 25 26
wondering who had the best deals we noticed a line had formed to wait for this one particular establishment .
0 9 10 13 14 17 18 21 22 26 27 32 33 35 36 43 44 45 46 50 51 54 55 61 62 64 65 69 70 73 74 78 79 82 83 93 94 107 107 108

yes , they use fancy ingredients , but even fancy ingredients do n't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .
0 3 3 4 5 9 10 13 14 19 20 31 31 32 33 36 37 41 42 47 48 59 60 62 62 65 66 70 71 74 75 79 80 85 86 92 93 100 101 106 107 110 111 113 114 117 118 121 122 127 128 133 133 134
looking from the outside in , one would hesitate to enter this hole in the wall -lrb- really , that 's what it is -rrb- .

tuk tuk is one of those comfortable neighborhood joints where you know you will always have a good meal at a fair price .

a glass of leaping lizard , a glass of prosecco , and the mussels had everything happy .

food was average and creme brulee was awful - the sugar was charred , not caramelized and smelled of kerosene .
0 4 5 8 9 16 17 20 21 26 27 33 34 37 38 43 44 45 46 49 50 55 56 59 60 67 67 68 69 72 73 84 85 88 89 96 97 99 100 108 108 109

the pizza here is delicious .

my entire family was horrified .

on a monthly basis my friends and i get together and have a girls night out .

for great chinese food nearby , you have wu liang ye and grand sichuan just a block away .

but who says murray 's is anything about service .
0 3 4 7 8 12 13 19 19 21 22 24 25 33 34 39 40 47 47 48
this place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant , the food .
0 4 5 10 11 13 14 20 21 27 28 31 32 36 37 41 42 51 52 57 58 61 62 66 67 76 77 81 82 84 85 86 88 98 98 99 100 103 104 108 108 109

hats off to the chef .
0 4 5 8 9 11 12 15 16 20 20 21
this should have been done in a back room - away from customers .
0 4 5 11 12 16 17 21 22 26 27 29 30 31 32 36 37 41 42 43 44 48 49 53 54 63 63 64
service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things -lrb- the heavy , black , antique-seeming teapot , for one -rrb- in the restaurant experience .
0 7 8 13 14 16 17 25 26 29 30 37 38 42 43 45 46 47 48 53 54 58 59 70 71 74 75 85 86 88 89 95 96 102 103 104 104 107 108 113 113 114 115 120 120 121 122 137 138 144 144 145 146 149 150 153 153 154 155 157 158 161 162 172 173 183 183 184

the pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap , frozen , shredded cheese common to most pizzaria 's .
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 22 23 24 25 29 30 33 34 39 40 50 51 58 59 61 62 65 66 71 71 72 73 79 79 80 81 89 90 96 97 103 104 106 107 111 112 120 120 122 122 123

first off , the waitress was completely unattentive the 2 times we saw her -lrb- odd in a restaurant with 6 tables -rrb- and got our order wrong .
0 5 6 9 9 10 11 14 15 23 24 27 28 38 39 50 51 54 55 56 57 62 63 65 66 69 70 73 73 74 74 77 78 80 81 82 83 93 94 98 99 100 101 107 107 108 109 112 113 116 117 120 121 126 127 132 132 133

i understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .

eating in , the atmosphere saves it , but at your desk , it 's a very disappointing experience .

regardless of whether there are two people or two hundred people ahead of you the hostess will take your name and tell you five minutes .

0 3 4 11 12 17 18 21 22 25 26 30 31 35 36 45 45 46 47 56 57 58 59 62 63 69 69 70
by the time we were done , it was past 1:00 am .

spice is great thai food , love the inexpensive appetizers .
0 5 6 8 9 14 15 19 20 24 24 25 26 30 31 34 35 46 47 57 57 58
read all the other review , they 'll confirm it .
0 4 5 8 9 12 13 18 19 25 25 26 27 31 31 34 35 42 43 45 45 46
even after they overcharged me the last time i was there .
0 4 5 10 11 15 16 27 28 30 31 34 35 39 40 44 45 46 47 50 51 56 56 57
the service was attentive .
0 3 4 11 12 15 16 25 25 26
he not only makes his own homemade mozzarella , but every pie is ultra fresh .
0 2 3 6 7 11 12 17 18 21 22 25 26 34 35 45 45 46 47 50 51 56 57 60 61 63 64 69 70 75 75 76
fish was overdone .
0 4 5 8 9 17 17 18
great idea and base for restaurant , but work on the details , people who think this was good need to go back to the shore towns and rethink what it should have tasted like .
0 5 6 10 11 14 15 19 20 23 24 34 34 35 36 39 40 44 45 47 48 51 52 59 59 60 61 67 68 71 72 77 78 82 83 86 87 91 92 96 97 99 100 102 103 107 108 110 111 114 115 120 121 126 127 130 131 138 139 143 144 146 147 153 154 158 159 165 166 170 170 171
when you 're sitting in their main dining room -lrb- which has a spectacular , hand-painted high ceiling -rrb- you 'd never know there was a world outside .
0 4 5 8 8 11 12 19 20 22 23 28 29 33 34 40 41 45 46 47 47 52 53 56 57 58 59 70 70 71 72 84 85 89 90 97 97 98 99 102 102 104 105 110 111 115 116 121 122 125 126 127 128 133 134 141 141 142
we visited bread bar during january restaurant week and were so pleased with the menu selections and service .
0 2 3 10 11 16 17 20 21 27 28 35 36 46 47 51 52 55 56 60 61 63 64 71 72 76 77 80 81 85 86 96 97 100 101 108 108 109
i have been twice to this restaurant .
0 1 2 6 7 11 12 17 18 20 21 25 26 36 36 37
also make sure you pay attention to the music being piped in - quite a weird selection .
0 4 5 9 10 14 15 18 19 22 23 32 33 35 36 39 40 45 46 51 52 57 58 60 61 62 63 68 69 70 71 76 77 86 86 87
you could get a much better dining experience for the same amount of money in a lot of other french bistros .
0 3 4 9 10 13 14 15 16 20 21 27 28 34 35 45 46 49 50 53 54 58 59 65 66 68 69 74 75 77 78 79 80 83 84 86 87 92 93 99 100 107 107 108
the establishment scores big points in presentation and style .
0 3 4 17 18 24 25 28 29 35 36 38 39 51 52 55 56 61 61 62
the rest of the dim sum , though pricey by chinatown standards , is worth it .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 15 16 19 20 23 23 24 25 31 32 38 39 41 42 51 52 61 61 62 63 65 66 71 72 74 74 75
good food .
0 4 5 9 9 10
the wait staff is very friendly , if not overly efficient .
0 3 4 8 9 14 15 17 18 22 23 31 31 32 33 35 36 39 40 46 47 56 56 57
surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth .
0 12 13 20 21 26 27 29 30 37 38 42 43 46 47 52 52 53
the dim sum however was very good .
0 3 4 7 8 11 12 19 20 23 24 28 29 33 33 34
it 's better than being on the roof of sutton place with 19 year old interns jabbing you in the ribs all night .
0 2 2 4 5 11 12 16 17 22 23 25 26 29 30 34 35 37 38 44 45 50 51 55 56 58 59 63 64 67 68 75 76 83 84 87 88 90 91 94 95 99 100 103 104 109 109 110
service has always been friendly and efficient .
0 7 8 11 12 18 19 23 24 32 33 36 37 46 46 47
went there and had a combination of different seafood dishes and appetizers .
0 4 5 10 11 14 15 18 19 20 21 32 33 35 36 45 46 53 54 60 61 64 65 75 75 76
its a great place for a casual date or to entertain clients for lunch .
0 3 4 5 6 11 12 17 18 21 22 23 24 30 31 35 36 38 39 41 42 51 52 59 60 63 64 69 69 70
all we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner .
0 3 4 6 7 15 16 19 20 22 23 30 31 33 34 36 37 41 42 44 45 48 49 52 53 57 58 65 66 72 72 73
the table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes himself when their long overdue bottle of wine finally arrived .
0 3 4 9 10 14 15 17 18 20 21 26 27 29 30 32 33 40 41 44 45 51 52 59 60 64 65 70 71 75 76 83 84 90 91 93 94 98 99 106 107 114 114 115
prices are very good .
0 6 7 10 11 15 16 20 20 21
we could not catch our waiter 's eye , and he ignored us .
0 2 3 8 9 12 13 18 19 22 23 29 29 31 32 35 35 36 37 40 41 43 44 51 52 54 54 55
fantastic place .
0 9 10 15 15 16
plain and simple it 's bad thai food .
0 5 6 9 10 16 17 19 19 21 22 25 26 30 31 35 35 36
definitely not a restaurant to skip !
0 10 11 14 15 16 17 27 28 30 31 35 35 36
they refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends .
0 4 5 11 12 14 15 19 20 27 28 30 31 32 33 35 36 40 41 43 44 52 52 53
usually 3 vs. 4 items per dish .
0 7 8 9 10 13 14 15 16 21 22 25 26 30 30 31
while certain staples are excellent -lrb- the burger , some of the pastas -rrb- , the food is not really the point .
0 5 6 13 14 21 22 25 26 35 36 37 37 40 41 47 47 48 49 53 54 56 57 60 61 67 67 68 68 69 70 73 74 78 79 81 82 85 86 92 93 96 97 102 102 103
the dim sum was so-so , but not spectacular .
0 3 4 7 8 11 12 15 16 21 21 22 23 26 27 30 31 42 42 43
the food was so-so .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 18 18 19
the waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing .
0 3 4 12 12 13 14 19 20 22 23 25 26 30 31 40 41 43 44 51 52 56 57 61 62 70 71 82 82 83
the place is larger than most and features adequate seating unlike most joints , and has a bar which deserves a mention .
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 19 20 24 25 29 30 33 34 42 43 51 52 59 60 66 67 71 72 78 78 79 80 83 84 87 88 89 90 93 94 99 100 108 109 110 111 118 118 119
what a ripoff !

there was a small wait , but shorter than i expected .

the lobster sandwich is $ 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price .
0 3 4 11 12 20 21 23 24 25 25 27 28 31 32 40 41 43 44 47 48 52 53 55 56 59 60 63 64 70 71 77 78 80 81 88 89 93 94 99 99 100
may , the owner always has a smile on her and will warmly greet you .
0 3 3 4 5 8 9 14 15 21 22 25 26 27 28 33 34 36 37 40 41 44 45 49 50 56 57 62 63 66 66 67
i 've lived in ny for 5 years and this place has it all .
0 1 1 4 5 10 11 13 14 16 17 20 21 22 23 28 29 32 33 37 38 43 44 47 48 50 51 54 54 55
i just read mocaramel 's review and felt compelled to respond .

the sides were ok and incredibly salty .
0 3 4 9 10 14 15 17 18 21 22 32 33 38 38 39
it hits the spot every time
0 2 3 7 8 11 12 16 17 22 23 27
for some reason , all the seafood on the menu was unavailable except for the salmon .
0 3 4 8 9 15 15 16 17 20 21 24 25 32 33 35 36 39 40 44 45 48 49 60 61 67 68 71 72 75 76 82 82 83

do n't be fooled by crowds of people .
0 2 2 5 6 8 9 15 16 18 19 25 26 28 29 35 35 36
and there 's no way out .
0 3 4 9 9 11 12 14 15 18 19 22 22 23
the beverages were excellent , and the dessert was good .
0 3 4 13 14 18 19 28 28 29 30 33 34 37 38 45 46 49 50 54 54 55
the hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out .
0 3 4 11 12 15 16 19 20 28 29 33 34 44 45 49 50 53 54 57 58 68 69 73 74 79 80 82 83 87 88 90 91 94 94 95
next time , we would n't dare ordering anything else other than some simple asian appetizers and drinks .
0 4 5 9 9 10 11 13 14 19 19 22 23 27 28 36 37 45 46 50 51 56 57 61 62 66 67 73 74 79 80 90 91 94 95 101 101 102

i must say the view of nyc is so beautiful !
0 1 2 6 7 10 11 14 15 19 20 22 23 26 27 29 30 32 33 42 42 43
if you 'd like to have a nice light meal with an asian accent , long tan is a good place on the slope .
0 2 3 6 6 8 9 13 14 16 17 21 22 23 24 28 29 34 35 39 40 44 45 47 48 53 54 60 60 61 62 66 67 70 71 73 74 75 76 80 81 86 87 89 90 93 94 99 99 100
when going out for a nice dinner , i like a nice ambiance as well as very good food .

0 9 9 10 11 15 16 21 22 25 26 31 32 39 40 43 44 50 51 54 55 56 57 61 62 70 71 81 81 82
highly recommend this as great value for excellent sushi and service .
0 6 7 16 17 21 22 24 25 30 31 36 37 40 41 50 51 56 57 60 61 68 68 69
this place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service .
0 4 5 10 11 16 17 19 20 22 23 27 28 34 35 41 42 44 45 50 51 54 55 57 58 59 60 65 66 70 71 79 80 91 92 100 101 108 108 109
a + + the service was good to excellent along with the attitude .
0 1 1 2 2 3 6 9 10 17 18 21 22 26 27 29 30 39 40 45 46 50 51 54 55 63 63 64
this is my fourth try over a two year period , and i 'm done .
0 4 5 7 8 10 11 17 18 21 22 26 27 28 29 32 33 37 38 44 44 45 46 49 50 51 51 53 54 58 58 59
the food is awesome - definitely try the striped bass .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 19 20 21 22 32 33 36 37 40 41 48 49 53 53 54
the music does get a little loud at times , but it just made me want to lean closer to my beautiful wife , and as i did , i got a whiff of corriander .
0 3 4 9 10 14 15 18 19 20 21 27 28 32 33 35 36 41 41 42 43 46 47 49 50 54 55 59 60 62 63 67 68 70 71 75 76 82 83 85 86 88 89 98 99 103 103 104 105 108 109 111 112 113 114 117 117 118 119 120 121 124 125 126 127 132 133 135 136 146 146 147
black white shakes came out good also .
0 5 6 11 12 18 19 23 24 27 28 32 33 37 37 38
it 's simply the best meal in nyc .
0 2 2 4 5 11 12 15 16 20 21 25 26 28 29 32 32 33
probably would not go again ...
0 8 9 14 15 18 19 21 22 27 27 30
after passing by this restaurant for sometime i finally decided to go in and have dinner .
0 5 6 13 14 16 17 21 22 32 33 36 37 45 46 47 48 55 56 63 64 66 67 69 70 72 73 76 77 81 82 88 88 89
the seating was if they were trying to get the maximum amount of people into the restaurant , so be nice to your neighbor when you dine here .
0 3 4 11 12 15 16 18 19 23 24 28 29 35 36 38 39 42 43 46 47 54 55 61 62 64 65 71 72 76 77 80 81 91 91 92 93 95 96 98 99 103 104 106 107 111 112 120 121 125 126 129 130 134 135 139 139 140
i ordered the chu chu curry and my friend ordered the pad thai chicken .
0 1 2 9 10 13 14 17 18 21 22 27 28 31 32 34 35 41 42 49 50 53 54 57 58 62 63 70 70 71
we go on mondays for the prix fixe and our experience with the food has been comparable to blue ribbon .
0 2 3 5 6 8 9 16 17 20 21 24 25 29 30 34 35 38 39 42 43 53 54 58 59 62 63 67 68 71 72 76 77 87 88 90 91 95 96 102 102 103
tuk tuk is my second favorite neighborhood thai place -lrb- the first being joya -rrb- .
0 3 4 7 8 10 11 13 14 20 21 29 30 42 43 47 48 53 54 55 55 58 59 64 65 70 71 75 75 76 76 77
however , they 've got the most amazing pastrami and the soups hit the spot .
0 7 7 8 9 13 13 16 17 20 21 24 25 29 30 37 38 46 47 50 51 54 55 60 61 64 65 68 69 73 73 74
great bagels made the old-fashioned way .
0 5 6 12 13 17 18 21 22 35 36 39 39 40
this is some really good , inexpensive sushi .
0 4 5 7 8 12 13 19 20 24 24 25 26 37 38 43 43 44
my personal favorite is an everything bagel with lox spread , but all the bagles are unbeliavably good .

the italian food has flavor -lrb- that can be sort of surprising on the ues -rrb- , and the service turns from a nightmare to attentive , they sort of remind me of the ny yankees of the late 90 's , no matter how bad it look , you knew that there was a rally just around the corner ...

the second you walk through the heavy vault like door , with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime .

searching to get out from the cold , freezing weather , we went into what we thought was a deli .

0 1 2 6 7 11 12 16 17 19 20 29 30 33 34 37 38 49 50 57 58 60 61 64 65 71 72 83 84 86 87 90 91 93 94 95 96 102 102 103
for $ 760 for 2 people , it 's a once in a lifetime experience .
0 3 4 5 5 8 9 12 13 14 15 21 21 22 23 25 25 27 28 29 30 34 35 37 38 39 40 48 49 59 59 60
the food is o.k. , but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 16 16 17 18 21 22 25 26 29 30 36 37 41 42 46 47 50 51 54 55 57 58 59 60 64 65 77 78 88 88 89
we had the pot-stickers which were great and a tempura dish that was great .
0 2 3 6 7 10 11 23 24 29 30 34 35 40 41 44 45 46 47 54 55 59 60 64 65 68 69 74 74 75

0 1 2 7 8 11 12 17 18 21 22 28 29 33 34 40 40 41
after reading the good reviews of this restaurant , i decided to give it a try with two friends .
0 5 6 13 14 17 18 22 23 30 31 33 34 38 39 49 49 50 51 52 53 60 61 63 64 68 69 71 72 73 74 77 78 82 83 86 87 94 94 95
while the $ 20 entree range is not overly expensive , in new york city , there is definitely better food in that range , and so sapphire , despite it 's lovely atmosphere , will most likely not be a restaurant to which i will return .
0 5 6 9 10 11 11 13 14 20 21 26 27 29 30 33 34 40 41 50 50 51 52 54 55 58 59 63 64 68 68 69 70 75 76 78 79 89 90 96 97 101 102 104 105 109 110 115 115 116 117 120 121 123 124 132 132 133 134 141 142 144 144 146 147 153 154 164 164 165 166 170 171 175 176 182 183 186 187 189 190 191 192 202 203 205 206 211 212 213 214 218 219 225 225 226
orsay , is without a doubt one of the best values for authentic french food in nyc .

i ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor .

food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection -lrb- though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience -rrb- .

looking around , i saw a room full of new yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen .

they do n't walk around with the trays of dim sum .

took my sister here before attending a show one evening .

great bar , most gorgeous bartenders you 've ever seen -lrb- specifically the blond lady -rrb- .

we were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order .

our friends have not arrived yet .
0 3 4 11 12 16 17 20 21 28 29 32 32 33
they came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existant .
0 4 5 9 10 13 14 18 19 25 26 29 30 33 34 40 41 44 45 51 52 55 56 64 64 65
i had a terrific meal , and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range , instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that was n't as good .

the svc can be a bit rude at times , esp if you have big group , but overall the restaurant is a must !
0 3 4 7 8 11 12 14 15 16 17 20 21 25 26 28 29 34 34 35 36 39 40 42 43 46 47 51 52 55 56 61 61 62 63 66 67 74 75 78 79 89 90 92 93 94 95 99 99 100
my husband and i thougt it would be great to go to the jekyll and hyde pub for our anniversary , and to our surprise it was fantastic .
0 2 3 10 11 14 15 16 17 23 24 26 27 32 33 35 36 41 42 44 45 47 48 50 51 54 55 61 62 65 66 70 71 74 75 78 79 82 83 94 94 95 96 99 100 102 103 106 107 115 116 118 119 122 123 132 132 133
never once did i leave feeling unwelcome or impressed .
0 5 6 10 11 14 15 16 17 22 23 30 31 40 41 43 44 53 53 54
the food is good , especially their more basic dishes , and the drinks are delicious .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 16 16 17 18 28 29 34 35 39 40 45 46 52 52 53 54 57 58 61 62 68 69 72 73 82 82 83
but the main hit was the whole grilled fish .
0 3 4 7 8 12 13 16 17 20 21 24 25 30 31 38 39 43 43 44
i had the tuna tartare with sake , mushroom ravioli with pinot noir , and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $ 49 .
0 1 2 5 6 9 10 14 15 22 23 27 28 32 32 33 34 42 43 50 51 55 56 61 62 66 66 67 68 71 72 75 76 85 86 93 94 98 99 100 101 108 109 113 114 117 118 119 119 121 121 122
on a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch .
0 2 3 4 5 8 9 12 13 15 16 19 20 28 29 31 32 36 37 39 40 43 44 49 50 55 55 56
the food is delicious and beautifully prepared along with the friendly and personable service .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 21 22 25 26 37 38 46 47 52 53 57 58 61 62 70 71 74 75 85 86 93 93 94
i usually go there later at night when i get off work so i do n't have to deal with crowds or lines .
0 1 2 9 10 12 13 18 19 24 25 27 28 33 34 38 39 40 41 44 45 48 49 53 54 56 57 58 59 61 61 64 65 69 70 72 73 77 78 82 83 89 90 92 93 98 98 99
pizza here is consistently good .
0 5 6 10 11 13 14 26 27 31 31 32
we had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar food was just what we were looking for .
0 2 3 6 7 8 9 14 15 19 20 28 29 32 33 38 39 42 43 53 54 57 58 60 61 65 66 69 70 74 75 79 80 82 83 87 88 95 96 99 99 100
after 2 tries by the waiter to take it away -lrb- we had n't even looked at it yet , we had full beers yet to drink -rrb- , the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations .
0 5 6 7 8 13 14 16 17 20 21 27 28 30 31 35 36 38 39 43 44 45 45 47 48 51 51 54 55 59 60 66 67 69 70 72 73 76 76 77 78 80 81 84 85 89 90 95 96 99 100 102 103 108 108 109 109 110 111 114 115 122 123 133 134 137 138 142 143 145 146 150 151 157 158 161 162 167 168 171 172 178 179 183 184 196 196 197
would n't recomend it for dinner !
0 5 5 8 9 17 18 20 21 24 25 31 31 32
sauce was watery and the food did n't have much flavor .
0 5 6 9 10 16 17 20 21 24 25 29 30 33 33 36 37 41 42 46 47 53 53 54
my husband and i enjoy sangria .
0 2 3 10 11 14 15 16 17 22 23 30 30 31
but after last night , spice grill is the only place i 'm eating indian cuisine .
0 3 4 9 10 14 15 20 20 21 22 27 28 33 34 36 37 40 41 45 46 51 52 53 53 55 56 62 63 69 70 77 77 78
we both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh .
0 2 3 7 8 13 14 17 18 19 20 25 26 30 31 34 35 39 40 44 45 51 52 58 59 62 63 68 68 69
first the wrong bread came out with the appetizer , then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course ...
0 5 6 9 10 15 16 21 22 26 27 30 31 35 36 39 40 49 49 50 51 55 56 60 61 62 63 68 69 71 72 77 78 79 80 86 87 92 93 95 96 100 101 104 105 107 108 112 113 119 119 122
not sure where the previous reviewer , lonk , dined , but saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food !
0 3 4 8 9 14 15 18 19 27 28 36 36 37 38 42 42 43 44 49 49 50 51 54 55 59 60 62 63 65 66 67 68 73 74 86 87 90 91 94 95 100 101 105 105 106
in an area sadly lacking in decent thai food , this is one of the best spots .
0 2 3 5 6 10 11 16 17 24 25 27 28 34 35 39 40 44 44 45 46 50 51 53 54 57 58 60 61 64 65 69 70 75 75 76
tell them herky sent you and get a free confused look from the waiter .
0 4 5 9 10 15 16 20 21 24 25 28 29 32 33 34 35 39 40 48 49 53 54 58 59 62 63 69 69 70
make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to time square .
0 4 5 17 18 21 22 28 29 31 32 34 35 42 43 48 49 56 57 59 60 63 64 71 72 77 78 81 82 88 89 99 100 107 108 114 115 118 119 126 127 131 132 133 134 145 146 153 154 158 159 167 168 171 172 173 174 177 178 180 181 185 186 189 190 195 196 198 199 204 205 207 208 212 213 219 219 220
the food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 20 21 23 24 29 30 39 40 44 45 55 56 61 62 68 68 69
they do n't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai .
0 4 5 7 7 10 11 15 16 18 19 24 25 27 28 36 37 39 40 48 49 51 52 57 58 69 70 75 76 78 79 81 82 84 85 94 95 98 99 103 104 108 108 109
other apetizers and food
0 5 6 15 16 19 20 24
the noodle and rices dishes taste great .
0 3 4 10 11 14 15 20 21 27 28 33 34 39 39 40
the food 's as good as ever .
0 3 4 8 8 10 11 13 14 18 19 21 22 26 26 27
the crust is thin , the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly .
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 17 17 18 19 22 23 34 35 38 39 44 45 48 49 52 53 58 59 61 62 70 70 71
your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem !
0 4 5 12 13 17 18 23 24 27 28 31 32 43 44 48 49 51 52 56 57 60 60 61
also a little more expensive than your average bagel place .
0 4 5 6 7 13 14 18 19 28 29 33 34 38 39 46 47 52 53 58 58 59
the food was undercooked-the sauce watery , and the vegetables raw .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 28 29 34 35 41 41 42 43 46 47 50 51 61 62 65 65 66
and the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make 'em worth eating .
0 3 4 7 8 13 14 19 20 23 24 28 29 35 36 40 41 43 44 48 49 51 52 56 57 60 61 66 67 73 73 74
the sauces used are also not that exciting .
0 3 4 10 11 15 16 19 20 24 25 28 29 33 34 42 42 43
the secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered .
0 3 4 10 11 13 14 17 18 23 24 28 29 34 35 41 42 43 44 57 58 67 68 72 73 78 79 85 86 93 93 94
i absolutely love this place !!!
0 1 2 12 13 17 18 22 23 28 28 31
the rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 17 18 25 26 29 30 33 34 40 41 43 44 49 50 52 53 56 57 61 61 62
we had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses !
0 2 3 6 7 16 17 20 21 27 28 31 32 36 37 41 42 52 52 53
the shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful .
0 3 4 10 11 17 18 21 22 31 32 35 36 39 40 49 50 54 55 64 64 65
i am surprised to say the least and find such practice not worth the effort .
0 1 2 4 5 14 15 17 18 21 22 25 26 31 32 35 36 40 41 45 46 54 55 58 59 64 65 68 69 75 75 76
when my dessert came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .
0 4 5 7 8 15 16 20 20 21 22 27 28 31 32 33 34 40 41 43 44 46 47 48 49 52 53 60 61 67 68 73 74 77 78 81 82 83 84 87 88 95 96 99 100 106 107 111 112 116 117 121 122 124 125 132 133 135 136 144 145 149 150 153 154 158 158 159 160 163 164 168 169 171 172 176 177 179 180 183 184 185 186 193 194 203 204 206 207 211 212 216 216 217
i got the $ 10 10-piece dim sum combo , every bite of which was great .

there are other vietnamese restaurants in the chinatown area and you can forget about those .
0 5 6 9 10 15 16 26 27 38 39 41 42 45 46 55 56 60 61 64 65 68 69 72 73 79 80 85 86 91 91 92
there is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial wait in getting food at peak times .
0 5 6 8 9 13 14 18 19 26 27 34 35 38 39 44 45 48 49 51 52 53 54 65 66 70 71 73 74 81 82 86 87 89 90 94 95 100 100 101
if it 's just a quick martini at the bar -lrb- which i recommend jeffery 's -rrb- or a mind blowing roast chicken , go to village !
0 2 3 5 5 7 8 12 13 14 15 20 21 28 29 31 32 35 36 39 40 41 41 46 47 48 49 58 59 66 66 68 68 69 70 72 73 74 75 79 80 87 88 93 94 101 101 102 103 105 106 108 109 116 116 117
no thanks !!!
0 2 3 9 9 12
there was a long wait for a table outside , but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice .
0 5 6 9 10 11 12 16 17 21 22 25 26 27 28 33 34 41 41 42 43 46 47 49 50 53 54 55 56 62 63 66 67 70 71 73 74 77 78 81 82 88 89 91 92 95 96 101 102 107 108 111 112 116 117 121 121 122
i would definently recommend this restaurant .
0 1 2 7 8 18 19 28 29 33 34 44 44 45
the prices are wonderfully low .
0 3 4 10 11 14 15 26 27 30 30 31
if you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo .
0 2 3 6 7 11 12 17 18 22 23 26 27 30 31 38 39 47 47 48
i love this place !
0 1 2 6 7 11 12 17 17 18
i have never been disappointed but their true strength lays in their amazingly delicious and cheap lunch specials .
0 1 2 6 7 12 13 17 18 30 31 34 35 40 41 45 46 54 55 59 60 62 63 68 69 78 79 88 89 92 93 98 99 104 105 113 113 114
so much more than the usual bar food , go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their hand-crafted beers .
0 2 3 7 8 12 13 17 18 21 22 27 28 31 32 36 36 37 38 40 41 46 47 49 50 55 56 59 60 64 65 70 71 79 80 83 84 86 87 92 93 105 106 111 111 112
a big disappointment , all around .
0 1 2 5 6 20 20 21 22 25 26 32 32 33
and its absolutely delicious .
0 3 4 7 8 18 19 28 28 29
no free drink .
0 2 3 7 8 13 13 14
i would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i ca n't not mention or undermine .
0 1 2 7 8 11 12 16 17 20 21 24 25 29 30 33 34 39 40 43 44 47 48 57 58 60 61 63 64 71 72 80 81 85 86 87 88 90 90 93 94 97 98 105 106 108 109 118 118 119
this is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent .

nha trang , while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor , horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals , is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i 've ever been to . the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables .

on the other hand , if you are not fooled easily , you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with alain ducasse , and food that will outshine in presentaion , taste , choice , quality and quantity .

i live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene but also the promise of the pizza place at 3am .

if i could rate the people this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza , sorry - not the best in nyc .

the food is amazing !!!!
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 19 19 23
having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit , but the food was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues .
0 6 7 10 11 15 16 20 21 23 24 27 28 32 33 34 35 40 41 44 45 49 50 54 55 63 64 65 66 69 69 70 71 74 75 78 79 83 84 87 88 93 94 97 98 103 104 108 109 112 113 116 117 121 122 127 128 136 137 142 143 145 146 153 154 160 160 161
the portions are now very small , the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .
0 3 4 12 13 16 17 20 21 25 26 31 31 32 33 36 37 43 44 47 48 64 65 72 73 81 82 87 88 91 92 99 100 102 103 108 109 113 113 114 115 118 119 129 129 130 131 134 135 137 138 141 142 152 152 153 154 159 160 167 167 168

with so many good restaurants on the uws , i do n't need overpriced food , absurdly arrogant wait-staff who do n't recognize they work at a glorified diner , clumsy service , and management that does n't care .

i tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose .

the bruscetta is a bit soggy , but the salads were fresh , included a nice mix of greens -lrb- not iceberg -rrb- all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen .

it 's very spicy but not offensive .

my friend 's food was also the complete opposite of what it 's supposed to taste like -lrb- and look like -rrb- .

awsome pizza especially the margheritta slice .
0 6 7 12 13 23 24 27 28 39 40 45 45 46
this place , however , has a lot less pretension than joya and the thai food is still above-average .
0 4 5 10 10 11 12 19 19 20 21 24 25 26 27 30 31 35 36 46 47 51 52 56 57 60 61 64 65 69 70 74 75 77 78 83 84 97 97 98

uni from maine vs california , sea vs freshwater eel -rrb- to get a good taste comparison .

the crispy chicken was n't for us , though .

this is one of our all-time favorite .
0 4 5 7 8 11 12 14 15 18 19 27 28 36 36 37
in reality -lrb- to maximize potential diners -rrb- they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby .
0 2 3 10 11 12 12 14 15 23 24 33 34 40 40 41 42 46 47 51 52 57 58 64 65 70 71 83 84 87 88 100 101 107 108 110 111 116 117 124 125 127 128 131 132 137 137 138
the wine is always good , the tapas are always yummy , especially with the warm pita bread .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 18 19 23 23 24 25 28 29 34 35 38 39 45 46 51 51 52 53 63 64 68 69 72 73 77 78 82 83 88 88 89
but when you are seated the waitresses are great , they explain everything on the menu , and the price of the food is really cheap for the service you get .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 16 17 23 24 27 28 38 39 42 43 48 48 49 50 54 55 62 63 73 74 76 77 80 81 85 85 86 87 90 91 94 95 100 101 103 104 107 108 112 113 115 116 122 123 128 129 132 133 136 137 144 145 148 149 152 152 153

it 's super-trendy and there 's always someone to take that empty seat , so it seems that customer service has been deemed not of the essence .
0 2 2 4 5 17 18 21 22 27 27 29 30 36 37 44 45 47 48 52 53 57 58 63 64 68 68 69 70 72 73 75 76 81 82 86 87 95 96 103 104 107 108 112 113 119 120 123 124 126 127 130 131 138 138 139
dinner took almost 4 hours without any lag time .
0 6 7 11 12 18 19 20 21 26 27 34 35 38 39 42 43 47 47 48
the people in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud .
0 3 4 10 11 13 14 17 18 28 29 33 34 40 41 50 51 54 55 59 59 60

0 3 4 14 15 18 19 22 22 23 24 33 34 37 38 41 42 52 52 53
the problem is just that-it is a sometimes kind of affair .

the fried rice is really good too .
0 3 4 9 10 14 15 17 18 24 25 29 30 33 33 34
we were well attended to by the enthusiastic staff especially the manager tony gaskin who made excellent suggestions for our menu selections .

0 2 3 7 8 10 11 15 16 26 27 32 33 35 36 41 42 50 51 59 59 60
still stay away , the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were serves eventhough they were there much longer ...
0 5 6 10 11 15 15 16 17 20 21 26 27 31 32 34 35 37 38 44 45 48 49 54 55 57 58 63 64 67 68 76 77 81 82 88 89 99 100 104 105 109 110 115 116 120 121 127 127 130
i was with a party of 7 -lrb- close but not next the the front doors -rrb- and we were eating with our coats on .

a very inviting restaurant , with friendly service .
0 1 2 6 7 15 16 26 26 27 28 32 33 41 42 49 49 50
the back garden sitting area is very pleasant , where you can see their personal herb garden .
0 3 4 8 9 15 16 23 24 28 29 31 32 36 37 45 45 46 47 52 53 56 57 60 61 64 65 70 71 79 80 84 85 91 91 92
what 's the difference between the two ?
0 4 4 6 7 10 11 21 22 29 30 33 34 37 37 38
will go back but only sate those homesick stomach cravings !
0 4 5 7 8 12 13 16 17 21 22 26 27 32 33 41 42 49 50 58 58 59
good french restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you 're into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at katz ' deli , or mexican food which is supplied by capable restaurants .
0 4 5 11 12 22 23 25 26 28 29 33 34 40 41 43 44 50 51 62 63 69 70 73 73 76 77 81 82 88 89 90 91 96 97 105 106 116 117 119 120 124 124 125 126 130 130 131 132 134 135 142 143 147 148 153 154 156 157 165 166 168 169 176 177 188 188 189
i was very disappointed with this restaurant .
0 1 2 5 6 10 11 23 24 28 29 33 34 44 44 45
the drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced .
0 3 4 10 11 14 15 21 22 27 28 32 33 36 37 41 42 51 52 54 55 61 62 68 68 69
we also had shared a house salad that was fresh .
0 2 3 7 8 11 12 18 19 20 21 26 27 32 33 37 38 41 42 47 47 48
the ceiling is amazing !
0 3 4 11 12 14 15 22 22 23
my wife and i were in nyc celebrating our 30th anniversary .
0 2 3 7 8 11 12 13 14 18 19 21 22 25 26 37 38 41 42 46 47 58 58 59
i 'm glad i was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in ny .
0 1 1 3 4 8 9 10 11 14 15 25 26 28 29 33 34 39 40 43 44 48 49 51 52 53 54 58 59 62 63 65 66 68 68 69
and at the conclusion of this culinary nightmare the check was given to our table by knocking over a glass of water .
0 3 4 6 7 10 11 21 22 24 25 29 30 38 39 48 49 52 53 58 59 62 63 68 69 71 72 75 76 81 82 84 85 93 94 98 99 100 101 106 107 109 110 115 115 116
not a small feat for good french food in the area .
0 3 4 5 6 11 12 16 17 20 21 25 26 32 33 37 38 40 41 44 45 49 49 50
the space is a bit too small for live music , so on jazz nights , it can be loud and cramped .
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 14 15 18 19 22 23 28 29 32 33 37 38 43 43 44 45 47 48 50 52 56 57 63 63 64 65 67 68 71 72 74 75 79 80 83 84 91 91 92
food was average but tasty .
0 4 5 8 9 16 17 20 21 26 26 27
we come from new jersey to eat at kinoko .
0 2 3 7 8 12 13 16 17 23 24 26 27 30 31 33 34 40 40 41
big wong gets big ups for a fine establishment .
0 3 4 8 9 13 14 17 18 21 22 25 26 27 28 32 33 46 46 47
will never be back .
0 4 5 10 11 13 14 18 18 19
the entree was bland and small , dessert was not inspired .
0 3 4 10 11 14 15 20 21 24 25 30 30 31 32 39 40 43 44 47 48 56 56 57
i highly recommend it .
0 1 2 8 9 18 19 21 21 22
oh and it 's too tiny for families with strollers .
0 2 3 6 7 9 9 11 12 15 16 20 21 24 25 33 34 38 39 48 48 49
the staff was the friendliest that have seen in new york .
0 3 4 9 10 13 14 17 18 29 30 34 35 39 40 44 45 47 48 51 52 56 56 57
with the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering , the food here was decent , not great .
0 4 5 8 9 18 19 21 22 25 26 31 32 37 38 42 43 46 47 49 50 54 55 61 62 64 65 67 68 72 73 76 77 81 82 89 90 98 98 99 100 103 104 108 109 113 114 117 118 124 124 125 126 129 130 135 135 136
the pad thai , lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but , i 've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places .
0 3 4 7 8 12 12 13 14 17 18 21 22 25 26 33 34 39 40 46 47 50 51 55 56 60 61 63 64 69 70 73 73 74 75 76 76 79 80 83 84 90 91 95 96 100 101 103 104 108 109 121 122 130 131 137 137 138
delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door .
0 9 10 14 15 17 18 19 20 25 26 31 32 35 36 38 39 42 43 45 46 50 51 53 54 55 56 60 61 64 65 68 69 72 73 75 76 79 80 85 86 90 90 91
my picks : guizhou chicken , fish with hot bean source , fish fillet in spicy source -lrb- special menu -rrb- .
0 2 3 8 8 9 10 17 18 25 25 26 27 31 32 36 37 40 41 45 46 52 52 53 54 58 59 65 66 68 69 74 75 81 82 83 83 90 91 95 95 96 96 97
overall , i 'm still impressed that the place even exists and the prices are quite decent but then again , its chinatown .
0 7 7 8 9 10 10 12 13 18 19 28 29 33 34 37 38 43 44 48 49 55 56 59 60 63 64 70 71 74 75 80 81 87 88 91 92 96 97 102 102 103 104 107 108 117 117 118
admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm , but the open kitchen is part of the charm .
0 10 11 15 16 22 23 29 30 33 34 44 45 49 50 56 57 61 61 62 63 66 67 70 71 75 76 83 84 86 87 91 92 94 95 98 99 104 104 105
my six year old loved it .
0 2 3 6 7 11 12 15 16 21 22 24 24 25
pizza was a little soggy .
0 5 6 9 10 11 12 18 19 24 24 25
the food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great indian appetizers .
0 3 4 8 9 16 17 23 24 35 36 42 43 48 49 54 55 59 60 62 63 71 71 72 73 80 81 84 85 91 92 98 98 99 100 102 103 107 108 110 111 116 117 122 123 129 130 140 140 141
the singapore mai fun had no curry flavor whatsoever .
0 3 4 13 14 17 18 21 22 25 26 28 29 34 35 41 42 52 52 53
the only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent .
0 3 4 8 9 16 17 19 20 24 25 28 29 36 37 39 40 41 42 50 51 62 62 63
the wine list is interesting and has many good values .
0 3 4 8 9 13 14 16 17 28 29 32 33 36 37 41 42 46 47 53 53 54
murray wo n't do it .
0 6 7 9 9 12 13 15 16 18 18 19
i 'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food .
0 1 1 3 4 9 10 13 14 18 19 20 21 24 25 27 28 31 32 35 36 41 42 46 46 47
this restaurant used to be our regular thursday night dinner location .
0 4 5 15 16 20 21 23 24 26 27 30 31 38 39 47 48 53 54 60 61 69 69 70
definite go if you 're used to good indian restaurant food from abroad .
0 8 9 11 12 14 15 18 18 21 22 26 27 29 30 34 35 41 42 52 53 57 58 62 63 69 69 70
thr at moshphere is compact , modern , yet cozy .
0 3 4 6 7 16 17 19 20 27 27 28 29 35 35 36 37 40 41 45 45 46
by far , the best pizza in manhattan .
0 2 3 6 6 7 8 11 12 16 17 22 23 25 26 35 35 36
decent thai food in cute - though a bit dank - little nolita hangout , but service terrible .
0 6 7 11 12 16 17 19 20 24 25 26 27 33 34 35 36 39 40 44 45 46 47 53 54 60 61 68 68 69 70 73 74 81 82 90 90 91
most people eat there seem to be typical upper east side snobs , so be aware .
0 4 5 11 12 15 16 21 22 26 27 29 30 32 33 40 41 46 47 51 52 56 57 62 62 63 64 66 67 69 70 75 75 76
the waiter actually poured water on my hand and walked away .
0 3 4 10 11 19 20 26 27 32 33 35 36 38 39 43 44 47 48 54 55 59 59 60
the food is mostly made from scratch , fresh and well prepared .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 18 19 23 24 28 29 36 36 37 38 43 44 47 48 52 53 61 61 62
worse of all , $ 60 was erroneously added to our $ 80 bill .
0 5 6 8 9 12 12 13 14 15 15 17 18 21 22 33 34 39 40 42 43 46 47 48 48 50 51 55 55 56
too cold to enjoy .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 17 17 18
no more reservations , expensive tips and annoying stuff .
0 2 3 7 8 20 20 21 22 31 32 36 37 40 41 49 50 55 55 56
try the sea bass .
0 3 4 7 8 11 12 16 16 17
$ 20 gets you unlimited sushi of a very high quality - i even took a friend here from japan who said it was one of the best sushi places in the us that he has been to .
0 1 1 3 4 8 9 12 13 22 23 28 29 31 32 33 34 38 39 43 44 51 51 52 53 54 55 59 60 64 65 66 67 73 74 78 79 83 84 89 90 93 94 98 99 101 102 105 106 109 110 112 113 116 117 121 122 127 128 134 135 137 138 141 142 144 145 149 150 152 153 156 157 161 162 164 164 165
i brought some buddies from ca and they loved it .
0 1 2 9 10 14 15 22 23 27 28 30 31 34 35 39 40 45 46 48 48 49
inside is a little cramped , but to be expected .
0 6 7 9 10 11 12 18 19 26 26 27 28 31 32 34 35 37 38 46 46 47
sushi was n't anything spectacular for the price .
0 5 6 9 9 12 13 21 22 33 34 37 38 41 42 47 47 48
during our meal , the management came over and checked on us and even bought us a round of drinks .
0 6 7 10 11 15 15 16 17 20 21 31 32 36 37 41 42 45 46 53 54 56 57 59 60 63 64 68 69 75 76 78 79 80 81 86 87 89 90 96 96 97
but they do n't have a toaster , which is strange .
0 3 4 8 9 11 11 14 15 19 20 21 22 29 29 30 31 36 37 39 40 47 47 48
so , for good food i 'd recommend it , but not for a fun night out .
0 2 2 3 4 7 8 12 13 17 18 19 19 21 22 31 32 34 34 35 36 39 40 43 44 47 48 49 50 53 54 59 60 63 63 64
the menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked .
0 3 4 8 9 16 17 20 21 28 29 32 33 36 37 42 43 49 50 54 55 61 62 66 67 69 70 76 76 77
a must for all the dosa lovers .
0 1 2 6 7 10 11 14 15 18 19 23 24 30 30 31
the portions are huge , so it might be good to order three things to split -lrb- rather than one appetizer and entree per person -rrb- for two people .
0 3 4 12 13 16 17 21 21 22 23 25 26 28 29 34 35 37 38 42 43 45 46 51 52 57 58 64 65 67 68 73 74 75 75 81 82 86 87 90 91 100 101 104 105 111 112 115 116 122 122 123 124 127 128 131 132 138 138 139
the appetizers are just ok and the main courses were decidedly subpar .
0 3 4 14 15 18 19 23 24 26 27 30 31 34 35 39 40 47 48 52 53 62 63 69 69 70
someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that .
0 7 8 12 13 24 25 28 29 36 37 38 39 41 42 46 47 51 52 56 56 57
the exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations .
0 3 4 10 11 15 16 18 19 30 31 40 41 44 45 47 48 49 50 57 58 60 61 70 71 83 83 84
the staff is very attentive and we can almost always get a table .
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 17 18 27 28 31 32 34 35 38 39 45 46 52 53 56 57 58 59 64 64 65
if you are a vegetarian , this really is n't a good place to go .
0 2 3 6 7 10 11 12 13 23 23 24 25 29 30 36 37 39 39 42 43 44 45 49 50 55 56 58 59 61 61 62
try the mediterranean salad , it is a true experience for your taste buds !!
0 3 4 7 8 21 22 27 27 28 29 31 32 34 35 36 37 41 42 52 53 56 57 61 62 67 68 72 72 74
i 'm sure i 'll return for a final judgement tho .
0 1 1 3 4 8 9 10 10 13 14 20 21 24 25 26 27 32 33 42 43 46 46 47
of course , it is crowded but who cares .
0 2 3 9 9 10 11 13 14 16 17 24 25 28 29 32 33 38 38 39
this quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my manhattan restaurant list .
0 4 5 11 12 15 16 24 25 34 35 37 38 40 41 44 45 48 49 51 52 54 55 64 65 75 76 80 80 81
i 've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences .
0 1 1 4 5 9 10 15 16 21 22 27 28 31 32 36 37 43 44 47 48 57 58 69 69 70
people are always friendly .
0 6 7 10 11 17 18 26 26 27
the cream cheeses are out of this world and i love that coffee !!
0 3 4 9 10 17 18 21 22 25 26 28 29 33 34 39 40 43 44 45 46 50 51 55 56 62 62 64
from the entrees to the sides to the drinks , everything was creatively prepared yet still simple .
0 4 5 8 9 16 17 19 20 23 24 29 30 32 33 36 37 43 43 44 45 55 56 59 60 70 71 79 80 83 84 89 90 96 96 97
hmmm .
0 4 4 5
service was prompt and courteous .
0 7 8 11 12 18 19 22 23 32 32 33
it was not above ordinary and the beef version had cheap -lrb- undercooked -rrb- beef .
0 2 3 6 7 10 11 16 17 25 26 29 30 33 34 38 39 46 47 50 51 56 57 58 58 69 69 70 71 75 75 76
chance is a small cozy restaurant , with a romantic feel to it , the decor is great .
0 6 7 9 10 11 12 17 18 22 23 33 33 34 35 39 40 41 42 50 51 55 56 58 59 61 61 62 63 66 67 72 73 75 76 81 81 82
it was nice and fresh , but i ca n't give it high scores on being authentic thai .
0 2 3 6 7 11 12 15 16 21 21 22 23 26 27 28 29 31 31 34 35 39 40 42 43 47 48 54 55 57 58 63 64 73 74 78 78 79
overall , worht every penny .

only wine and beer are served , but the house varities are actually quite good .

this place must have cost the owners afortune to build .

oh , and the complimentary pudding dessert was just enough - yummy !

knowledge of the chef and the waitress are below average .
0 9 10 12 13 16 17 21 22 25 26 29 30 38 39 42 43 48 49 56 56 57
we were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks .
0 2 3 7 8 15 16 22 23 26 27 34 35 38 39 43 44 48 49 53 54 59 60 64 65 68 69 73 74 80 80 81
decent wine selection too .
0 6 7 11 12 21 22 25 25 26
go with a group of friends and you will have a great time .
0 2 3 7 8 9 10 15 16 18 19 26 27 30 31 34 35 39 40 44 45 46 47 52 53 57 57 58
it saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy , crowded bar at dinnertime .
0 2 3 8 9 16 17 19 20 23 24 31 32 35 36 37 38 43 44 46 47 50 51 56 57 62 62 63 64 71 72 75 76 78 79 89 89 90
i have to say i have never had a disapointing meal here .
0 1 2 6 7 9 10 13 14 15 16 20 21 26 27 30 31 32 33 45 46 50 51 55 55 56
it 's one of our favorite places to eat in ny .
0 2 2 4 5 8 9 11 12 15 16 24 25 31 32 34 35 38 39 41 42 44 44 45
the place does get crowded , so i recommend going between 4-5 pm .
0 3 4 9 10 14 15 18 19 26 26 27 28 30 31 32 33 42 43 48 49 56 57 60 61 63 63 64
mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta -lrb- raddichio was kind of bitter though -rrb- .
0 4 5 8 9 10 11 17 18 23 24 27 28 33 34 43 44 48 49 53 54 60 61 64 65 74 75 76 76 85 86 89 90 94 95 97 98 104 105 111 111 112 112 113
disappointing food , lousy service .
0 13 14 18 18 19 20 25 26 33 33 34
i 'm from sichuan , this is the restaurant i recommend going .
0 1 1 3 4 8 9 16 16 17 18 22 23 25 26 29 30 40 41 42 43 52 53 58 58 59
this lovely french-asian fusion restaurant stands out amongst other great restaurants on smith street .
0 4 5 11 12 24 25 31 32 42 43 49 50 53 54 61 62 67 68 73 74 85 86 88 89 94 95 101 101 102
if you want a casual neighborhood bistro that has great food and excellent service , this is the place .
0 2 3 6 7 11 12 13 14 20 21 33 34 40 41 45 46 49 50 55 56 60 61 64 65 74 75 82 82 83 84 88 89 91 92 95 96 101 101 102
great place to go for a drink too because they have 100 kinds of beer .
0 5 6 11 12 14 15 17 18 21 22 23 24 29 30 33 34 41 42 46 47 51 52 55 56 61 62 64 65 69 69 70
but this place is a well-oiled machine so they know what they 're doing .
0 3 4 8 9 14 15 17 18 19 20 30 31 38 39 41 42 46 47 51 52 56 57 61 61 64 65 70 70 71
over price , and small portions .
0 4 5 10 10 11 12 15 16 21 22 30 31 32
meanwhile , the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil , gratis .
0 9 9 10 11 14 15 24 25 34 35 37 38 42 43 52 53 57 58 61 62 69 70 75 76 78 79 82 83 91 92 95 96 102 103 106 107 109 110 117 118 120 121 126 127 129 130 136 137 141 142 146 147 153 154 159 159 160 161 167 167 168
but i 'd go back

stepped on my foot on the second time he reached over me to adjust lighting .
0 7 8 10 11 13 14 18 19 21 22 25 26 32 33 37 38 40 41 48 49 53 54 56 57 59 60 66 67 75 75 76
the food was well prepared and the service impecable .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 17 18 26 27 30 31 34 35 42 43 52 52 53
but their best dish is thh thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp - a dish that would cost $ 23.95 is most places , but it is $ 16 here .
0 3 4 9 10 14 15 19 20 22 23 26 27 31 32 38 39 44 45 52 53 57 58 64 65 66 67 68 69 73 74 78 79 84 85 89 90 91 91 96 97 99 100 104 105 111 111 112 113 116 117 119 120 122 123 124 124 126 127 131 131 132
good , dark atmosphere and the music is a nice touch .
0 4 4 5 6 10 11 21 22 25 26 29 30 35 36 38 39 40 41 45 46 51 51 52
my husband said the portions were very small , but if my main course was good to eat the portion would 've been fine for me .
0 2 3 10 11 15 16 19 20 28 29 33 34 38 39 44 44 45 46 49 50 52 53 55 56 60 61 67 68 71 72 76 77 79 80 83 84 87 88 95 96 101 101 104 105 109 110 114 115 118 119 121 121 122
but the thai is definitely not great -- bland and indistinguished .
0 3 4 7 8 12 13 15 16 26 27 30 31 36 37 39 40 45 46 49 50 65 65 66
this thai restaurant is a couple blocks away from sripraphai -lrb- another delicious thai restaurant -rrb- .
0 4 5 9 10 20 21 23 24 25 26 32 33 39 40 44 45 49 50 60 61 62 62 69 70 79 80 84 85 95 95 96 96 97
great for groups , great for a date , great for early brunch or a nightcap .
0 5 6 9 10 16 16 17 18 23 24 27 28 29 30 34 34 35 36 41 42 45 46 51 52 58 59 61 62 63 64 72 72 73
authentic shanghai style and i can not recommend a better shanghai place in new york .
0 9 10 18 19 24 25 28 29 30 31 34 34 37 38 47 48 49 50 56 57 65 66 71 72 74 75 78 79 83 83 84
our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese .
0 3 4 12 13 19 20 24 25 30 31 35 36 47 48 51 52 56 57 61 62 66 67 70 71 80 81 84 85 88 89 97 98 100 101 104 105 110 111 113 114 118 119 126 127 136 137 145 146 149 150 154 155 158 159 165 165 166
perhaps the last reviewer -lrb- who stated she was treated with attitude -rrb- lives in a parallel universe because i have never had anything but a perfect experience at yasuda .
0 7 8 11 12 16 17 25 26 27 27 30 31 37 38 41 42 45 46 53 54 58 59 67 67 68 69 74 75 77 78 79 80 88 89 97 98 105 106 107 108 112 113 118 119 122 123 131 132 135 136 137 138 145 146 156 157 159 160 166 166 167
that said , i thought scalini fedeli was one of the best dining experiences i 've ever had .
0 4 5 9 9 10 11 12 13 20 21 28 29 35 36 39 40 43 44 46 47 50 51 55 56 62 63 74 75 76 76 79 80 84 85 88 88 89
everything about this restaurant was special .
0 10 11 16 17 21 22 32 33 36 37 44 44 45
because we did n't have a reservation , we could only sit in the back garden , but it was great , secluded and perfect in nice weather .
0 7 8 10 11 14 14 17 18 22 23 24 25 36 36 37 38 40 41 46 47 51 52 55 56 58 59 62 63 67 68 74 74 75 76 79 80 82 83 86 87 92 92 93 94 102 103 106 107 114 115 117 118 122 123 130 130 131
stuffing yourself with japanese food is a rare thing .
0 8 9 17 18 22 23 31 32 36 37 39 40 41 42 46 47 52 52 53
i try my best to give an accurate description of any establishment visited .
0 1 2 5 6 8 9 13 14 16 17 21 22 24 25 33 34 45 46 48 49 52 53 66 67 74 74 75
while the food was good -lrb- certainly no il mulino -rrb- the service was horrendous .
0 5 6 9 10 14 15 18 19 23 24 25 25 34 35 37 38 40 41 47 47 48 49 52 53 60 61 64 65 75 75 76
it is expensive but well worth the money .
0 2 3 5 6 15 16 19 20 24 25 30 31 34 35 40 40 41
service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category .
0 7 8 10 11 14 15 19 20 23 24 29 30 36 37 41 42 43 44 49 50 52 53 57 58 63 64 72 72 73
our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant .
0 3 4 10 11 16 17 25 26 30 31 41 42 55 56 58 59 60 61 71 71 72
i would recommend reservations on weekends though .

there are many thai places in the city but so far toons is # 1 .

great pizza for lunch place .
0 5 6 11 12 15 16 21 22 27 27 28
the food was very expensive -lrb- we spent $ 160 for lunch for two -rrb- but extremely tasty .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 17 18 27 28 29 29 31 32 37 38 39 39 42 43 46 47 52 53 56 57 60 60 61 62 65 66 75 76 81 81 82

0 1 2 4 4 7 8 13 14 15 16 21 22 24 25 30 30 31
we were a group of 8 and well seved .
0 2 3 7 8 9 10 15 16 18 19 20 21 24 25 29 30 35 35 36
and that 's no mean feat ...
0 3 4 8 8 10 11 13 14 18 19 23 23 26
i often go there to eat with my family .
0 1 2 7 8 10 11 16 17 19 20 23 24 28 29 31 32 38 38 39
i wish they would change back to what it was before .

the signs , the specials menus , food , and even all the waitstaff are all totally japanese .
0 3 4 9 9 10 11 14 15 23 24 29 29 30 31 35 35 36 37 40 41 45 46 49 50 53 54 63 64 67 68 71 72 79 80 88 88 89
no pizza 33 for me !
0 2 3 8 9 11 12 15 16 18 18 19
i love their spicy scallop roll , and my boyfriend consistently gets the sesame chicken .
0 1 2 6 7 12 13 18 19 26 27 31 31 32 33 36 37 39 40 49 50 62 63 67 68 71 72 78 79 86 86 87
i 'm no food critic , but i 'd like to think i have a tiny bit of experience under my belt having lived in ny for the last 11 years .
0 1 1 3 4 6 7 11 12 18 18 19 20 23 24 25 25 27 28 32 33 35 36 41 42 43 44 48 49 50 51 55 56 59 60 62 63 73 74 79 80 82 83 87 88 94 95 100 101 103 104 106 107 110 111 114 115 119 120 122 123 128 128 129
i noted it was crossed off on the bill .
0 1 2 7 8 10 11 14 15 22 23 26 27 29 30 33 34 38 38 39
needless to say , i 'm never going back and you should be wary too .
0 8 9 11 12 15 15 16 17 18 18 20 21 26 27 32 33 37 38 41 42 45 46 52 53 55 56 60 61 64 64 65
best dish is nori-wrapped tuna .
0 4 5 9 10 12 13 25 26 30 30 31
the food was absolutely amazing !!
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 23 24 31 31 33
some servers make you feel like they are doing you a favor to bring you the food .
0 4 5 12 13 17 18 21 22 26 27 31 32 36 37 40 41 46 47 50 51 52 53 58 59 61 62 67 68 71 72 75 76 80 80 81
an excellent alternative to fast food joints and ordering in but , the food was slightly disappointing .
0 2 3 12 13 24 25 27 28 32 33 37 38 44 45 48 49 57 58 60 61 64 64 65 66 69 70 74 75 78 79 87 88 101 101 102
mermaid inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood .

i work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time .
0 1 2 6 7 13 14 17 18 24 25 28 29 34 35 37 38 42 43 44 45 54 55 58 59 62 63 68 69 73 73 74

0 1 2 6 7 11 12 16 17 19 20 29 30 33 34 41 42 48 48 49
the staff is also attentive and friendly .
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 17 18 27 28 31 32 40 40 41
the all you can eat deal is truly amazing here .
0 3 4 7 8 11 12 15 16 19 20 24 25 27 28 33 34 41 42 46 46 47
that is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish , and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste .
0 4 5 7 8 9 10 17 18 23 24 26 27 31 32 37 38 40 41 46 47 48 49 53 53 54 55 58 59 62 63 65 66 71 72 73 74 80 81 83 84 87 88 89 90 96 97 102 102 103
this is definitely a place that provides the best experience , though , to both a-listers and people walking in off the street .
0 4 5 7 8 18 19 20 21 26 27 31 32 40 41 44 45 49 50 60 60 61 62 68 68 69 70 72 73 77 78 87 88 91 92 98 99 106 107 109 110 113 114 117 118 124 124 125
they were such a rip-off -lrb- $ 8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns -rrb- and not worth trying .
0 4 5 9 10 14 15 16 17 24 25 26 26 27 27 31 32 35 36 40 41 46 47 51 52 59 60 62 63 70 71 75 75 76 77 80 81 84 85 90 91 97 97 98

i stumbled upon this great pizzeria as i explored my new neighborhood .
0 1 2 10 11 15 16 20 21 26 27 35 36 38 39 40 41 49 50 52 53 56 57 69 69 70
after hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant , and passing by it on a daily basis , we decided to try .
0 5 6 13 14 15 16 19 20 22 23 28 29 35 36 41 42 45 46 56 56 57 58 61 62 69 70 72 73 75 76 78 79 80 81 86 87 92 92 93 94 96 97 104 105 107 108 111 111 112
the service , however , was a bright flower in a garden .
0 3 4 11 11 12 13 20 20 21 22 25 26 27 28 34 35 41 42 44 45 46 47 53 53 54
so , again , give it a try .
0 2 2 3 4 9 9 10 11 15 16 18 19 20 21 24 24 25
stay far away from this place .
0 4 5 8 9 13 14 18 19 23 24 29 29 30
we will come back !!!
0 2 3 7 8 12 13 17 17 20
we 've been to grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed .
0 2 2 5 6 10 11 13 14 21 22 27 28 33 34 37 38 41 42 46 47 50 51 53 54 58 59 61 62 65 66 70 71 83 83 84
the food is very good too but for the most part , it 's just regular food , nothing special .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 16 17 21 22 25 26 29 30 33 34 37 38 42 43 47 47 48 49 51 51 53 54 58 59 66 67 71 71 72 73 80 81 88 88 89
a touch more jalapeno heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed .
0 1 2 7 8 12 13 21 22 26 27 30 31 39 40 43 44 46 47 52 53 57 58 62 63 67 68 72 73 79 79 80
tried the pad see ew on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it 's one of my favorite dishes .
0 5 6 9 10 13 14 17 18 20 21 23 24 27 28 42 43 45 46 49 50 54 55 63 64 69 70 72 72 74 75 78 79 81 82 84 85 93 94 100 100 101
we 'd go back again
0 2 2 4 5 7 8 12 13 18
we ate out in the back patio , which is worth it as it 's cool and the music is hear well there .
0 2 3 6 7 10 11 13 14 17 18 22 23 28 28 29 30 35 36 38 39 44 45 47 48 50 51 53 53 55 56 60 61 64 65 68 69 74 75 77 78 82 83 87 88 93 93 94
the location is perfect .

guacamole + shrimp appetizer was really great , we both had the filet , very good , did n't much like the frites that came with , but the filet was so good , neither of us cared .

the lunch special is an asbolute steal .
0 3 4 9 10 17 18 20 21 23 24 32 33 38 38 39
this food is asian-air fusion .
0 4 5 9 10 12 13 22 23 29 29 30
nothing fancy but really good food with pretty reasonable price .
0 7 8 13 14 17 18 24 25 29 30 34 35 39 40 46 47 57 58 63 63 64
the chicken pot pie is excpetiona , the cheeseburger huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm .
0 3 4 11 12 15 16 19 20 22 23 33 33 34 35 38 39 51 52 56 57 60 61 71 71 72 73 76 77 80 81 88 89 101 102 105 106 110 110 111
while i quite liked the food and the ambience , i 'm not quite sure if it they really deserve it the michelin rating they have displayed so prooudly in the window .
0 5 6 7 8 13 14 19 20 23 24 28 29 32 33 36 37 45 45 46 47 48 48 50 51 54 55 60 61 65 66 68 69 71 72 76 77 83 84 91 92 94 95 98 99 107 108 114 115 119 120 124 125 134 135 137 138 146 147 149 150 153 154 160 160 161
i 'm surprised about some of the bad reviews posted here - i 've been to tamarind about 5 or 6 times and always come away extremely satisfied and looking forward to returning .
0 1 1 3 4 13 14 19 20 24 25 27 28 31 32 35 36 43 44 50 51 55 56 57 58 59 59 62 63 67 68 70 71 79 80 85 86 87 88 90 91 92 93 98 99 102 103 109 110 114 115 119 120 129 130 139 140 143 144 151 152 159 160 162 163 172 172 173
but on a lazy saturday night , we ended up going .

there are a few italian employees who may not speak the best english but for me that adds to the experience .
0 5 6 9 10 11 12 15 16 23 24 33 34 37 38 41 42 45 46 51 52 55 56 60 61 68 69 72 73 76 77 79 80 84 85 89 90 92 93 96 97 107 107 108
i have never eaten in the restaurant , however , upon reading the reviews i got take out last week .
0 1 2 6 7 12 13 18 19 21 22 25 26 36 36 37 38 45 45 46 47 51 52 59 60 63 64 71 72 73 74 77 78 82 83 86 87 91 92 96 96 97
once for dinner and once for brunch .
0 4 5 8 9 15 16 19 20 24 25 28 29 35 35 36
i 've been to at cafe spice probably 5-8 times , it is probably still the best indian restaurant around union square .
0 1 1 4 5 9 10 12 13 15 16 20 21 26 27 35 36 39 40 45 45 46 47 49 50 52 53 61 62 67 68 71 72 76 77 83 84 94 95 101 102 107 108 114 114 115
not worth the prices .
0 3 4 9 10 13 14 20 20 21
would recommend - perfect for those looking for a place close to grand central .
0 5 6 15 16 17 18 25 26 29 30 35 36 43 44 47 48 49 50 55 56 61 62 64 65 70 71 78 78 79

0 3 4 8 9 11 12 15 16 19 20 29 30 37 38 41 42 48 48 49
the restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
0 3 4 14 15 17 18 19 20 23 24 29 30 33 34 38 39 41 42 51 52 56 57 60 61 63 64 74 75 79 80 83 84 87 88 92 93 96 97 102 103 104 105 110 111 115
being a fan of spicy ethnic foods , indian included , i made friends with this place long ago .
0 5 6 7 8 11 12 14 15 20 21 27 28 33 33 34 35 41 42 50 50 51 52 53 54 58 59 66 67 71 72 76 77 82 83 87 88 91 91 92
please save yourself the frustration .
0 6 7 11 12 20 21 24 25 36 36 37
and i say snacking because it really is not set up to be a proper dinner .
0 3 4 5 6 9 10 18 19 26 27 29 30 36 37 39 40 43 44 47 48 50 51 53 54 56 57 58 59 65 66 72 72 73

we were on our way back to nj , and since i am in ny , we figured why not grab some food ?
0 2 3 7 8 10 11 14 15 18 19 23 24 26 27 29 29 30 31 34 35 40 41 42 43 45 46 48 49 51 51 52 53 55 56 63 64 67 68 71 72 76 77 81 82 86 86 87
sandwiches tho pricey are over stuffed - can serve 2 persons easily thus cost effective !
0 10 11 14 15 21 22 25 26 30 31 38 39 40 41 44 45 50 51 52 53 60 61 67 68 72 73 77 78 87 87 88
and comparing it to the chinatown restaurants is simply not fair .

service and food is what any one would expect when spending that type of money .
0 7 8 11 12 16 17 19 20 24 25 28 29 32 33 38 39 45 46 50 51 59 60 64 65 69 70 72 73 78 78 79

0 4 5 8 9 19 20 21 22 26 27 31 32 33 34 37 38 40 41 46 46 47
every course was better than the next .
0 5 6 12 13 16 17 23 24 28 29 32 33 37 37 38
not cheap , but not that expensive either .
0 3 4 9 9 10 11 14 15 18 19 23 24 33 34 40 40 41
the staff is incredibly helpful and attentive .

the menu changed , portions were even smaller than before , a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility , a basmati rice dish lacked flavor .
0 3 4 8 9 16 16 17 18 26 27 31 32 36 37 44 45 49 50 56 56 57 58 59 60 66 67 71 72 75 76 81 82 88 89 98 98 99 100 101 102 109 110 114 115 119 120 126 127 133 133 134

although the tables may be closely situated , the candle-light , food-quality and service overcompensate .
0 8 9 12 13 19 20 23 24 26 27 34 35 43 43 44 45 48 49 61 61 62 63 75 76 79 80 87 88 102 102 103
the food was delicious and the waiter was incredibly helpful and attentive -lrb- considering we were the only ones there for the first hour -rrb- .

from the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff , i felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it .

0 5 6 16 17 22 23 28 28 29
definitely worth the trip to battery park city !
0 10 11 16 17 20 21 25 26 28 29 36 37 41 42 46 46 47
perhaps this food is considered extreme to an upper east side resident , but for the rest of us who 've actually eaten ethnic food , this is simply dull .
0 7 8 12 13 17 18 20 21 31 32 39 40 42 43 45 46 51 52 56 57 61 62 70 70 71 72 75 76 79 80 83 84 88 89 91 92 94 95 98 98 101 102 110 111 116 117 123 124 128 128 129 130 134 135 137 138 144 145 149 149 150
the place was real empty but that was because this was the first sunday they ever opened .
0 3 4 9 10 13 14 18 19 24 25 28 29 33 34 37 38 45 46 50 51 54 55 58 59 64 65 71 72 76 77 81 82 88 88 89
this little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money .

tasty but expensive .

you get the sense that the people there care about their restaurant and about your experience and that is very nice .

both are delicious , the cooks are friendly and are willing to take a moment and speak to you and shake your hand .
0 4 5 8 9 18 18 19 20 23 24 29 30 33 34 42 43 46 47 50 51 58 59 61 62 66 67 68 69 75 76 79 80 85 86 88 89 92 93 96 97 102 103 107 108 112 112 113
so i thought why not change it up a bit .

my friend ordered some of their special sushi rolls which had excellent presentation and tasted great !

although be warned their dinner menu to sit and take out prices are different .
0 8 9 11 12 18 19 24 25 31 32 36 37 39 40 43 44 47 48 52 53 56 57 63 64 67 68 77 77 78

my picks are : - scallion pancake -lrb- fried with vegetable juice , very special and tasty -rrb- - guizhou chicken - shredded squid family style -lrb- one of my personal favorites -rrb- - sichuan spicy soft shell crab - shuizhu fish -lrb- this one is for hardcore sichuan food fans , i would n't recommend to my american friends as it 's very spicy .

they smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone .
0 4 5 10 11 15 16 20 21 26 27 31 32 36 37 40 41 47 48 58 59 63 64 67 68 75 76 84 85 92 92 93
to celebrate a birthday , three of us went to mare anticipating great food .
0 2 3 12 13 14 15 23 23 24 25 30 31 33 34 36 37 41 42 44 45 49 50 62 63 68 69 73 73 74
there was a great deal for 6 blue point oysters and a beer or glass of wine for $ 8 !
0 5 6 9 10 11 12 17 18 22 23 26 27 28 29 33 34 39 40 47 48 51 52 53 54 58 59 61 62 67 68 70 71 75 76 79 80 81 81 82 82 83
i really liked the noodle dishes at rice avenue compared to their green curry dish .
0 1 2 8 9 14 15 18 19 25 26 32 33 35 36 40 41 47 48 56 57 59 60 65 66 71 72 77 78 82 82 83
i went to pams with my girlfriend , and i love it .

but for whatever reason , prices are about twice as high .
0 3 4 7 8 16 17 23 23 24 25 31 32 35 36 41 42 47 48 50 51 55 55 56
i am relatively new to the area and tried pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and i thought the food was overated and on the pricey side .
0 1 2 4 5 15 16 19 20 22 23 26 27 31 32 35 36 41 42 46 47 48 49 53 54 56 57 60 61 64 65 68 69 81 82 86 87 90 91 98 99 102 103 104 105 112 113 116 117 121 122 125 126 134 135 138 139 141 142 145 146 152 153 157 157 158
great atmoshere and worth every bit .
0 5 6 15 16 19 20 25 26 31 32 35 35 36
we had a most unpleasant experience at this restaurant .
0 2 3 6 7 8 9 13 14 24 25 35 36 38 39 43 44 54 54 55
the spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome , great appetizer to share !
0 3 4 9 10 14 15 19 20 23 24 33 34 38 39 42 43 46 47 51 52 58 59 66 67 70 71 78 78 79 80 85 86 95 96 98 99 104 104 105

0 3 4 9 10 13 14 27 28 31 32 36 37 39 40 51 51 52
great staff .
0 5 6 11 11 12
only complaint would be that at an average cost of $ 12 - $ 15 per meal , i 'd like not to have to worry about finding a seat !
0 4 5 14 15 20 21 23 24 28 29 31 32 34 35 42 43 47 48 50 51 52 52 54 54 55 55 56 56 58 59 62 63 67 67 68 69 70 70 72 73 77 78 81 82 84 85 89 90 92 93 98 99 104 105 112 113 114 115 119 119 120
to finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have dessert , especially the white chocolate bread pudding with gelato and hot chocolate .
0 2 3 9 10 13 14 18 19 20 21 31 32 38 39 49 50 53 54 58 59 63 64 71 71 72 73 83 84 87 88 93 94 103 104 109 110 117 118 122 123 129 130 133 134 137 138 147 147 148
the banana tower is an amazing dessert as well .
0 3 4 10 11 16 17 19 20 22 23 30 31 38 39 41 42 46 46 47
i went there with my friend last saturday .
0 1 2 6 7 12 13 17 18 20 21 27 28 32 33 41 41 42
excellent atmosphere , delicious dishes good and friendly service .
0 9 10 20 20 21 22 31 32 38 39 43 44 47 48 56 57 64 64 65
a cool place to hang with your friends for a couple of healthy drinks and desserts .
0 1 2 6 7 12 13 15 16 20 21 25 26 30 31 38 39 42 43 44 45 51 52 54 55 62 63 69 70 73 74 82 82 83
great vibe , lots of people .
0 5 6 10 10 11 12 16 17 19 20 26 26 27
i like mamoun 's food as well , but side by side , kati rolls just produce tastier food hands down .
0 1 2 6 7 13 13 15 16 20 21 23 24 28 28 29 30 33 34 38 39 41 42 46 46 47 48 52 53 58 59 63 64 71 72 79 80 84 85 90 91 95 95 96
just an odd group .
0 4 5 7 8 11 12 17 17 18
the service is a bit slow , but harkens back to my years growing up in napoli , italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night .
0 3 4 11 12 14 15 16 17 20 21 25 25 26 27 30 31 38 39 43 44 46 47 49 50 55 56 63 64 66 67 69 70 76 76 77 78 83 84 89 90 96 97 100 101 104 105 111 112 115 116 120 121 124 125 128 129 133 134 137 138 144 145 148 149 154 155 157 158 163 164 167 168 173 173 174
either that , or the editor 's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th .

0 1 2 6 7 11 12 17 17 18
it is not consistent .
0 2 3 5 6 9 10 20 20 21
but that was n't the icing on the cake : a tiramisu that resembled nothing i have ever had .
0 3 4 8 9 12 12 15 16 19 20 25 26 28 29 32 33 37 37 38 39 40 41 49 50 54 55 64 65 72 73 74 75 79 80 84 85 88 88 89

the one vegetarian entree -lrb- abby 's treasure -rrb- was actually quite a surprise - it was delicious and had wintermelon covering an assortment of fresh mushrooms and vegetables .
0 3 4 7 8 18 19 25 26 27 27 31 31 33 34 42 42 43 44 47 48 56 57 62 63 64 65 73 74 75 76 78 79 82 83 92 93 96 97 100 101 112 113 121 122 124 125 135 136 138 139 144 145 154 155 158 159 169 169 170
at 5 dumplings for $ 1 , you just can not go wrong .
0 2 3 4 5 14 15 18 19 20 20 21 21 22 23 26 27 31 32 35 35 38 39 41 42 47 47 48
but the pizza is way to expensive .
0 3 4 7 8 13 14 16 17 20 21 23 24 33 33 34
and the staff is also young , energeic and hot !!!!
0 3 4 7 8 13 14 16 17 21 22 27 27 28 29 37 38 41 42 45 45 49
even better , they know how to cook french classics like steak au poivre and onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it .
0 4 5 11 11 12 13 17 18 22 23 26 27 29 30 34 35 41 42 50 51 55 56 61 62 64 65 71 72 75 76 82 83 90 91 98 99 101 102 104 105 110 111 113 114 125 126 128 128 129
service was decent , but not as smooth as i would expect from a place with these prices and reputation .

when asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants , he replied this is not mcdonald 's , every place makes things differently while it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude .

while the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made tiffin so attractive , the menu has been overhauled .

only drawback - they wo n't toast your bagel , and they do n't make eggs for the bagel .

of course this atmosphere is lacking , but what do you expect from a 24 hour bagel place anyways ?

cornelia street looks like a broadway set for west side story and the inside of po is so cool quaint you really ca n't top the setting for a romantic dinner in nyc .

like others have said , do n't expect the restaurant to make a nite out romantic for you and yes , a busy restaurant may require you to wait .
0 4 5 11 12 16 17 21 21 22 23 25 25 28 29 35 36 39 40 50 51 53 54 58 59 60 61 65 66 69 70 78 79 82 83 86 87 90 91 94 94 95 96 97 98 102 103 113 114 117 118 125 126 129 130 132 133 137 137 138

food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when i went .

also , because it is so thin , it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling .
0 4 4 5 6 13 14 16 17 19 20 22 23 27 27 28 29 31 32 36 37 41 42 46 47 54 55 58 59 62 63 66 67 71 72 79 79 80
the food is nothing like its menu description .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 19 20 24 25 28 29 33 34 45 45 46
try the pad se-ew or chicken with cashew nuts for a memorable and repeatable experience .

the food is decent at best , and the ambience , well , it 's a matter of opinion , some may consider it to be a sweet thing , i thought it was just annoying .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 18 19 21 22 26 26 27 28 31 32 35 36 44 44 45 46 50 50 51 52 54 54 56 57 58 59 65 66 68 69 76 76 77 78 82 83 86 87 95 96 98 99 101 102 104 105 106 107 112 113 118 118 119 120 121 122 129 130 132 133 136 137 141 142 150 150 151

similar to other indian restaurants , they use the dinner special to attract customers at the door .
0 7 8 10 11 16 17 23 24 35 35 36 37 41 42 45 46 49 50 56 57 64 65 67 68 75 76 85 86 88 89 92 93 97 97 98

the people with carts of food do n't understand you because they do n't speak english , their job is to give you the delicious food you point at .

the crackling calamari salad , which is usually a cheap disaster at many restaurants , is crispy and lightly dressed .

drinks way over priced .
0 6 7 10 11 15 16 22 22 23
the main downside to the place is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level .

a bit breezy up there on the mezzanine from the wind coming from the tracks .

i went to df for valentines day dinner .
0 1 2 6 7 9 10 12 13 16 17 27 28 31 32 38 38 39
i recommend the jelly fish , drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings , certainly the stir fry blue crab .
0 1 2 11 12 15 16 21 22 26 26 27 28 35 36 43 44 47 48 51 52 57 58 67 67 68 69 78 79 82 83 87 88 91 92 96 97 101 101 102
i loved the shows .
0 1 2 7 8 11 12 17 17 18
and i have been around the block , to say the very least .
0 3 4 5 6 10 11 15 16 22 23 26 27 32 32 33 34 36 37 40 41 44 45 49 50 55 55 56
we could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu .
0 2 3 8 9 13 14 18 19 20 21 25 26 28 29 32 33 38 39 48 49 53 54 57 58 66 67 71 71 72
the aesthetics of this place are like an airport lounge .
0 3 4 14 15 17 18 22 23 28 29 32 33 37 38 40 41 48 49 55 55 56
then , get ripped on free box wine .

my wife and i ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food .
0 2 3 7 8 11 12 13 14 17 18 22 23 30 31 35 36 40 41 44 45 49 50 53 54 61 62 69 70 73 74 80 81 86 87 90 91 95 95 96
if you do n't mind pre-sliced low quality fish , unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place .
0 2 3 6 7 9 9 12 13 17 18 28 29 32 33 40 41 45 45 46 47 57 58 63 64 67 68 69 70 75 76 80 81 85 86 91 92 96 97 99 100 102 103 112 113 117 118 122 123 125 126 130 131 136 136 137
the food itself was just ok - nothing spectacular - but the service was awful .
0 3 4 8 9 15 16 19 20 24 25 27 28 29 30 37 38 49 50 51 52 55 56 59 60 67 68 71 72 77 77 78
the pizza is yummy and i like the atmoshpere .
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 18 19 22 23 24 25 29 30 33 34 44 44 45
as there were so many to choose from we wandered up and down the street looking in the windows and such noticicing many empty seats , except at taj mahal .
0 2 3 8 9 13 14 16 17 21 22 24 25 31 32 36 37 39 40 48 49 51 52 55 56 60 61 64 65 71 72 79 80 82 83 86 87 94 95 98 99 103 104 114 115 119 120 125 126 131 132 133 133 139 140 142 143 146 147 152 152 153
also , do n't plan on asking for your favorite roll , if it 's not on the menu , you ca n't have it .
0 4 4 5 6 8 8 11 12 16 17 19 20 26 27 30 31 35 36 44 45 49 49 50 51 53 54 56 56 58 59 62 63 65 66 69 70 74 74 75 76 79 80 82 82 85 86 90 91 93 93 94

good food .
0 4 5 9 9 10
... and that 's saying a lot .
0 3 3 6 7 11 11 13 14 20 21 22 23 26 26 27
those rolls were big , but not good and sashimi was n't fresh .
0 5 6 11 12 16 17 20 20 21 22 25 26 29 30 34 35 38 39 46 47 50 50 53 54 59 59 60
the pesto pizza was excellent , thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy italian cheese that i 'd never heard of before .
0 3 4 9 10 15 16 19 20 29 29 30 31 41 42 47 48 52 53 54 55 59 60 66 67 69 70 75 76 83 84 90 91 95 96 97 97 99 100 105 106 111 112 114 115 121 121 122
the only thing i could get attention from was one of at least two cats running around that kept batting at my table .
0 3 4 8 9 14 15 16 17 22 23 26 27 36 37 41 42 45 46 49 50 52 53 55 56 61 62 65 66 70 71 78 79 85 86 90 91 95 96 103 104 106 107 109 110 115 115 116
if your into thai . . you can not miss this great restaurant .
0 2 3 7 8 12 13 17 17 18 18 19 19 22 23 26 26 29 30 34 35 39 40 45 46 56 56 57
going to ballato 's is like coming home and eating in my own kitchen , an absolute delight !
0 5 6 8 9 16 16 18 19 21 22 26 27 33 34 38 39 42 43 49 50 52 53 55 56 59 60 67 67 68 69 71 72 80 81 88 88 89
try the spicy shrimp appetizer -lrb- again , not the greatest value in the world but worth the price -rrb- and the lamb vindaloo is great .
0 3 4 7 8 13 14 20 21 30 31 32 32 37 37 38 39 42 43 46 47 55 56 61 62 64 65 68 69 74 75 78 79 84 85 88 89 94 94 95 96 99 100 103 104 108 109 117 118 120 121 126 126 127
however , go for the ambience , and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world !
0 7 7 8 9 11 12 15 16 19 20 28 28 29 30 33 34 42 43 46 47 51 52 56 57 58 59 68 69 72 73 74 75 79 80 86 87 90 91 96 96 97
i think this is one of the more underrated places in the city .
0 1 2 7 8 12 13 15 16 19 20 22 23 26 27 31 32 42 43 49 50 52 53 56 57 61 61 62
for out-of-towners who will get a big thrill out of the location !
0 3 4 18 19 22 23 27 28 31 32 33 34 37 38 44 45 48 49 51 52 55 56 64 64 65
everyone that has ever come here with me has become a convert and returned regularly with their own friends .
0 8 9 13 14 17 18 22 23 27 28 32 33 37 38 40 41 44 45 51 52 53 54 61 62 65 66 74 75 84 85 89 90 95 96 99 100 107 107 108
food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
0 4 5 8 9 13 14 17 18 23 24 27 28 33 34 37 38 42 43 45 46 53 54 59
i go at least 3 times a month and have never been disappointed .
0 1 2 4 5 7 8 13 14 15 16 21 22 23 24 29 30 33 34 38 39 44 45 49 50 62 62 63
obviously the chinese translation of this place does not mean big wong , it actually means great prosperity .
0 9 10 13 14 21 22 33 34 36 37 41 42 47 48 52 53 56 57 61 62 65 66 70 70 71 72 74 75 83 84 89 90 95 96 106 106 107
i think the restaurant was too loud -lrb- when full -rrb- to be romantic .
0 1 2 7 8 11 12 22 23 26 27 30 31 35 36 37 37 41 42 46 46 47 48 50 51 53 54 62 62 63
i have had so many dinners here and it 's always been perfect - on a date with my husband , with my mom , with girlfriends and larger groups .
0 1 2 6 7 10 11 13 14 18 19 26 27 31 32 35 36 38 38 40 41 47 48 52 53 60 61 62 63 65 66 67 68 72 73 77 78 80 81 88 88 89 90 94 95 97 98 101 101 102 103 107 108 119 120 123 124 130 131 137 137 138

incredible food at a very agreable price brings me back just about every other day to this authentic thai restaurant .
0 10 11 15 16 18 19 20 21 25 26 34 35 40 41 47 48 50 51 55 56 60 61 66 67 72 73 78 79 82 83 85 86 90 91 100 101 105 106 116 116 117
i actually gave patroon another chance before writing this , but the second visit was even worse .
0 1 2 10 11 15 16 23 24 31 32 38 39 45 46 53 54 58 58 59 60 63 64 67 68 74 75 80 81 84 85 89 90 95 95 96
also , if you do n't want to sit at a certain table , you do n't have to !
0 4 4 5 6 8 9 12 13 15 15 18 19 23 24 26 27 30 31 33 34 35 36 43 44 49 49 50 51 54 55 57 57 60 61 65 66 68 68 69
unbelievable .
0 12 12 13
a little pricey but it really hits the spot on a sunday morning !
0 1 2 8 9 15 16 19 20 22 23 29 30 34 35 38 39 43 44 46 47 48 49 55 56 63 63 64
i 've been living in the columbia university area for about 10 years with 3 kids - now in their teens .

the menu has lots of options : i hope to go back to try those potato pancakes .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 17 18 20 21 28 28 29 30 31 32 36 37 39 40 42 43 47 48 50 51 54 55 60 61 67 68 76 76 77
as soon as i wake up on a saturday or sunday it is the first thing on my mind is when and how i will be getting to fried dumpling .
0 2 3 7 8 10 11 12 13 17 18 20 21 23 24 25 26 34 35 37 38 44 45 47 48 50 51 54 55 60 61 66 67 69 70 72 73 77 78 80 81 85 86 89 90 93 94 95 96 100 101 103 104 111 112 114 115 120 121 129 129 130
the staff is n't the friendliest or most competent , and i am stickler for service , but everything else about this place makes up for it .
0 3 4 9 10 12 12 15 16 19 20 31 32 34 35 39 40 49 49 50 51 54 55 56 57 59 60 68 69 72 73 80 80 81 82 85 86 96 97 101 102 107 108 112 113 118 119 124 125 127 128 131 132 134 134 135
my wife and i will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them , as they tend to offer large portions .
0 2 3 7 8 11 12 13 14 18 19 26 27 31 32 37 38 41 42 47 48 51 52 55 56 63 64 67 68 73 74 78 78 79 80 82 83 87 88 92 93 95 96 101 102 107 108 116 116 117
this restaurant was way overhyped .

i 've overheard comments from him to his employees that should not have been delivered in the dining area and i 've been sitting there while he lectured another customer .

0 1 2 9 10 11 12 15 16 20 21 24 25 29 30 32 33 39 39 40
not someplace i would seek to try out but if i am in the area again , i will certainly stop by .

if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items bbq-ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not-so-fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .
0 2 3 6 7 14 15 17 18 20 21 29 30 39 40 43 44 51 51 52 53 60 61 67 68 70 70 71 72 74 75 80 81 87 88 91 92 93 94 99 100 104 105 109 110 117 118 122 123 135 136 140 141 146 147 149 150 152 153 154 155 161 162 166 167 178 178 179

though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room -lrb- no matter what the size of your party -rrb- , the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters - you 'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you 're in .

i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small -lrb- especially the appetizers -rrb- , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer -lrb- 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing -rrb- , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .

the mussaman curry that i ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that i ordered in it , they graciously provided me with one piece of poorly cooked potato .

the red curry is weak and tasteless , the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy , the rice is often overcooked , and the seafood is pretty sketchy .

our son loves pizza and we have a certified neapolitan pizzaria in our home city -lrb- seattle -rrb- , we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant .

their bagels are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a ` special ' bagel experience .

while sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance , and probably has the best decor of any indian restaurant i have been to in new york city , the food was not what i had hoped for .

the decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the east village - not romantic , just simple , small and sparse .

the service does sometimes lack focus and it is not ideal if you are in a hurry but i have never been treated rudely .

i would definitely go back for a very special occasion , but not for regular fine dining .

all i can say is $ 2 pints during happy hour and the some of the cheapest oysters you 'll find in the city , though the quality is some of the best .
0 3 4 5 6 9 10 13 14 16 17 18 18 19 20 25 26 32 33 38 39 43 44 47 48 51 52 56 57 59 60 63 64 72 73 80 81 84 84 87 88 92 93 95 96 99 100 104 104 105 106 112 113 116 117 124 125 127 128 132 133 135 136 139 140 144 144 145

its a little out of the way if you do n't live in the neighborhood , but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are .
0 3 4 5 6 12 13 16 17 19 20 23 24 27 28 30 31 34 35 37 37 40 41 45 46 48 49 52 53 65 65 66 67 70 71 81 82 87 88 91 92 96 97 101 102 110 111 114 115 118 118 119

the sauce is delicious and the crust is perfect .
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 22 23 26 27 30 31 36 37 39 40 47 47 48
this is a great place to take out-of-towners , and perfect for watching the sunset .

you will pay a lot for the decore , but the food is no better or worse than a lot of other chinese and asian fusion places in ny .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 14 15 18 19 22 23 26 27 33 33 34 35 38 39 42 43 47 48 50 51 53 54 60 61 63 64 69 70 74 75 76 77 80 81 83 84 89 90 97 98 101 102 107 108 114 115 121 122 124 125 127 127 128

the service is not consistently excellent -- just decent .
0 3 4 11 12 14 15 18 19 31 32 41 42 44 45 49 50 56 56 57
the food , served in small tasting portions -lrb- as an option -rrb- is very good with each dish being better than the next .

you guys are awesome !
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 20 20 21
they do cater to american palates , but if you like it hot let them know and they are more than willing to oblige !

i loved this place !!
0 1 2 7 8 12 13 18 18 20
i had the mango chicken and i ca n't go on to tell you how delicious that was and the presentation was beatiful .

i care more about the food and ambience .
0 1 2 6 7 11 12 17 18 21 22 26 27 30 31 39 39 40
oh , but wait , we were out of drinks -lrb- which were also delightfully overpriced -rrb- .
0 2 2 3 4 7 8 12 12 13 14 16 17 21 22 25 26 28 29 35 36 37 37 42 43 47 48 52 53 65 66 76 76 77 77 78
avoid at all costs .
0 5 6 8 9 12 13 18 18 19

the service is fantastic .
0 3 4 11 12 14 15 24 24 25
i recommend that you try this hidden spot which will surely blowup very soon
0 1 2 11 12 16 17 20 21 24 25 29 30 36 37 41 42 47 48 52 53 59 60 66 67 71 72 76
the garlic mashed potatoes are hands down the best in the city !
0 3 4 10 11 17 18 26 27 30 31 36 37 41 42 45 46 50 51 53 54 57 58 62 62 63
food and service was okay .
0 4 5 8 9 16 17 20 21 25 25 26
great for a romantic evening , or a fun evening with friends ...
0 5 6 9 10 11 12 20 21 28 28 29 30 32 33 34 35 38 39 46 47 51 52 59 59 62
the lamb meat was under-cooked and extrmely chewy .
0 3 4 8 9 13 14 17 18 30 31 34 35 43 44 49 49 50
the best pad thai i 've ever had .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 17 18 19 19 22 23 27 28 31 31 32
over time , the food quality has decreased substantially , it is a lot less crowded than it used to , and the service must definitely be part of the reason .
0 4 5 9 9 10 11 14 15 19 20 27 28 31 32 41 42 55 55 56 57 59 60 62 63 64 65 68 69 73 74 81 82 86 87 89 90 94 95 97 97 98 99 102 103 106 107 114 115 119 120 130 131 133 134 138 139 141 142 145 146 152 152 153

we were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date .
0 2 3 7 8 14 15 22 23 26 27 30 31 37 38 45 46 49 50 54 55 58 59 62 63 66 67 69 70 76 77 80 81 83 84 88 88 89
i would just ask for no oil next time .
0 1 2 7 8 12 13 16 17 20 21 23 24 27 28 32 33 37 37 38
while this is a pretty place in that overly cute french way , the food was insultingly horrible .
0 5 6 10 11 13 14 15 16 22 23 28 29 31 32 36 37 43 44 48 49 55 56 59 59 60 61 64 65 69 70 73 74 85 86 94 94 95
i went there for lunch and it was not as good as i expected from the reviews i read .
0 1 2 6 7 12 13 16 17 22 23 26 27 29 30 33 34 37 38 40 41 45 46 48 49 50 51 59 60 64 65 68 69 76 77 78 79 83 83 84
i really did n't know what to expect for a restaurant that literally overlooks the main hall of grand central .
0 1 2 8 9 12 12 15 16 20 21 25 26 28 29 35 36 39 40 41 42 52 53 57 58 67 68 77 78 81 82 86 87 91 92 94 95 100 101 108 108 109
none of that yucky whipped stuff .
0 4 5 7 8 12 13 18 19 26 27 32 32 33
the wine list is n't great , and the desserts are shipped in from bruno 's down the street , which is not as good as it used to be .
0 3 4 8 9 13 14 16 16 19 20 25 25 26 27 30 31 34 35 43 44 47 48 55 56 58 59 63 64 69 69 71 72 76 77 80 81 87 87 88 89 94 95 97 98 101 102 104 105 109 110 112 113 115 116 120 121 123 124 126 126 127

their coffee is quite good too !
0 5 6 12 13 15 16 21 22 26 27 30 30 31
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
0 1 2 7 8 11 12 21 22 26 27 32 33 35 36 42 42 43
great wine list -lrb- italian -rrb- , good food , service was initially fine .

despite the fact that the space is large , they 've overcrowded the floor with tables .
0 7 8 11 12 16 17 21 22 25 26 31 32 34 35 40 40 41 42 46 46 49 50 61 62 65 66 71 72 76 77 83 83 84

as far as the service goes , the waitresses were not particularly friendly , but they got the job done .
0 2 3 6 7 9 10 13 14 21 22 26 26 27 28 31 32 42 43 47 48 51 52 64 65 73 73 74 75 78 79 83 84 87 88 91 92 95 96 100 100 101
they are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place , but also become hostile !
0 4 5 8 9 12 13 20 21 23 24 27 28 33 34 37 38 42 43 47 48 51 52 55 56 61 62 65 66 72 73 75 76 78 79 82 83 87 88 91 92 97 98 102 103 108 109 115 116 119 120 124 125 128 129 133 134 140 141 148 149 153 154 159 159 160 161 164 165 169 170 176 177 184 184 185

unlike other places in nyc where the sandwiches you want only come as a triple-decker , here you can get what you want in a reasonably-sized portion -lrb- and price -rrb- .

the sushi has been from average to below average , the wait service has always been sub-par the atmosphere goes from nice to really irritating -lrb- if you sit in the area beyond the kitchen , the acousitcs are horrid , everything echoes is extremely loud -rrb- .

alone for 100 bucks , it is really overprice .

out of the hundreds of italian restaurants in queens , this is among the best .

i would recommend putting your name down and then getting a drink at a local bar first though because of the wait time .

light , refreshing summer rolls -lrb- not fried -rrb- remind me of vietnamese places in paris .

0 5 6 10 11 15 15 16
but the service was a bit slow .
0 3 4 7 8 15 16 19 20 21 22 25 26 30 30 31
spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey .

when i saw that their website had a link to da ciro in napoli , i knew there was going to be good pizza !

no one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our plates .
0 2 3 6 7 12 13 17 18 21 22 27 28 30 31 33 34 38 39 43 44 51 52 59 60 62 63 66 67 73 73 74
indoor was very cozy and cute .
0 6 7 10 11 15 16 20 21 24 25 29 29 30
we had a 3 hour brunch - they definitely do not rush you - and they kept the unlimited mimosas flowing the whole time .
0 2 3 6 7 8 9 10 11 15 16 22 22 23 24 28 29 39 40 42 43 46 47 51 52 55 55 56 57 60 61 65 66 70 71 74 75 84 85 92 93 100 101 104 105 110 111 115 115 116
and their prices are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and service !

this place is a literal hole-in-the-wall that is buried within doyers , right off of pell st -lrb- barber 's alley -rrb- in chinatown .

if you 're not familiar with the cuisine , you may encounter problems ordering here and be sure to bring plenty of cash with you as they do n't accept credit cards .

this was n't the expected menu comprised only of pad thai and tom yum soup , but i thought that was what made the place so special .
0 4 5 8 8 11 12 15 16 24 25 29 30 39 40 44 45 47 48 51 52 56 57 60 61 64 65 68 69 73 73 74 75 78 79 80 81 88 89 93 94 97 98 102 103 107 108 111 112 117 118 120 121 128 128 129

i went with 5 friends and we lingered at the table for a bit and did n't feel rushed at all even though there was a wait .

i 'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service .
0 1 1 3 4 10 11 20 21 23 24 27 28 29 30 37 38 46 47 49 50 52 53 61 62 65 66 74 75 82 83 86 87 91 92 99 99 100
the burger was great , also .
0 3 4 10 11 14 15 20 20 21 22 26 26 27
they did give a 15 % discount at the end , was n't enough , as they knew the service was horrible .

just because it 's cheap does not mean the portions are small or the food is nasty , it is great !
0 4 5 12 13 15 15 17 18 23 24 28 29 32 33 37 38 41 42 50 51 54 55 60 61 63 64 67 68 72 73 75 76 81 81 82 83 85 86 88 89 94 94 95
the pizza was great .

i had never had edamame pureed before but i thought it was innovative and tasty -lrb- could 've used a bit more salt -rrb- .

however , it 's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth .
0 7 7 8 9 11 11 13 14 17 18 25 26 30 31 37 38 39 40 43 44 49 50 52 53 55 56 61 61 62
when we notified him that he did n't mention the specials , he did n't apologize but let us know that we made a very good decision regardless .
0 4 5 7 8 16 17 20 21 25 26 28 29 32 32 35 36 43 44 47 48 56 56 57 58 60 61 64 64 67 68 77 78 81 82 85 86 88 89 93 94 98 99 101 102 106 107 108 109 113 114 118 119 127 128 138 138 139
the price was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and food we ate .
0 3 4 9 10 13 14 23 24 34 35 38 39 42 43 53 54 57 58 62 63 65 66 69 69 70
do n't dine at tamarind for the vegetarian dishes , they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections .
0 2 2 5 6 10 11 13 14 22 23 26 27 30 31 41 42 48 48 49 50 54 55 58 59 65 66 69 70 72 73 75 76 79 80 84 85 88 89 96 97 107 107 108
kenny the owner is always there and he treats my family like we are part of his family .
0 5 6 9 10 15 16 18 19 25 26 31 32 35 36 38 39 45 46 48 49 55 56 60 61 63 64 67 68 72 73 75 76 79 80 86 86 87
they need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the place is consistent .
0 4 5 9 10 11 12 16 17 20 21 23 24 26 27 30 31 36 37 41 42 45 46 51 52 54 55 61 62 66 67 70 71 74 75 80 81 83 84 94 94 95
i 've had to wait only a few times during lunch but this place is definitely worth the wait .
0 1 1 4 5 8 9 11 12 16 17 21 22 23 24 27 28 33 34 40 41 46 47 50 51 55 56 61 62 64 65 75 76 81 82 85 86 90 90 91
all in all the food was above average and i would return to see how they operate with four or less dinners .
0 3 4 6 7 10 11 14 15 19 20 23 24 29 30 37 38 41 42 43 44 49 50 56 57 59 60 63 64 67 68 72 73 80 81 85 86 90 91 93 94 98 99 106 106 107
judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer .
0 7 8 12 13 21 22 27 28 32 33 37 38 40 41 43 44 45 46 50 51 56 56 57 58 61 62 65 66 69 70 76 76 77
delicious food , excellent service , and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $ 5.99 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch !
0 9 10 14 14 15 16 25 26 33 33 34 35 38 39 40 41 47 48 58 59 63 64 68 69 70 71 76 77 83 84 87 88 94 95 98 99 102 103 104 104 108 109 114 115 121 122 127 128 130 131 133 134 138 139 145 146 152 153 156 157 162 162 163
for appetizers , i recommend the shrimp fritters and dumplings .
0 3 4 14 14 15 16 17 18 27 28 31 32 38 39 47 48 51 52 61 61 62

such nice people working here - but i have to review the food .
0 4 5 9 10 16 17 24 25 29 30 31 32 35 36 37 38 42 43 45 46 52 53 56 57 61 61 62
the restaurant is dark and not very attractive and then you have spot lights shining on you putting you in the worst light possible , reaching for sunglasses .
0 3 4 14 15 17 18 22 23 26 27 30 31 35 36 46 47 50 51 55 56 59 60 64 65 69 70 76 77 84 85 87 88 91 92 99 100 103 104 106 107 110 111 116 117 122 123 131 131 132 133 141 142 145 146 156 156 157

great wine , great food .
0 5 6 10 10 11 12 17 18 22 22 23
the service was mediocre , and the lack of air conditioning made for a less than comfortable meal .
0 3 4 11 12 15 16 24 24 25 26 29 30 33 34 38 39 41 42 45 46 58 59 63 64 67 68 69 70 74 75 79 80 91 92 96 96 97
the food and staff always surprise me with the new heights they are taken to .

we try frequenting new restaurants all over the city , but any time that we visit a restaurant other than roth 's we are always disappointed .
0 2 3 6 7 18 19 22 23 34 35 38 39 43 44 47 48 52 52 53 54 57 58 61 62 66 67 71 72 74 76 81 82 83 84 94 95 100 101 105 106 110 110 112 113 115 116 119 120 126 127 139 139 140
honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives .

there is nothing more pleasant than that .

however , if you want great food at a great price and do n't mind the decor , you ca n't beat this place .
0 7 7 8 9 11 12 15 16 20 21 26 27 31 32 34 35 36 37 42 43 48 49 52 53 55 55 58 59 63 64 67 68 73 73 74 75 78 79 81 81 84 85 89 90 94 95 100 100 101
what makes this restaurant special are the authentic sichuan cooking and being the only one in nyc that offers authentic chongqing hotpot .

our tiny table for two -lrb- dinner plates hung over edge -rrb- was right in the middle of one of the lanes of waiter traffic .

one of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood .
0 3 4 6 7 9 10 18 19 30 31 33 34 37 38 50 50 51
one of my favorites though was the angry lobster , a cold lobster salad that was magnificent .
0 3 4 6 7 9 10 19 20 26 27 30 31 34 35 40 41 48 48 49 50 51 52 56 57 64 65 70 71 75 76 79 80 91 91 92

its location is good and the fact that hutner college is near and their prices are very reasonable , makes students go back to suan again and again .
0 3 4 12 13 15 16 20 21 24 25 28 29 33 34 38 39 45 46 53 54 56 57 61 62 65 66 71 72 78 79 82 83 87 88 98 98 99 100 105 106 114 115 117 118 122 123 125 126 130 131 136 137 140 141 146 146 147

i 'm just reading some of these reviews and its nonsense that people are reviewing some places because it was too loud .

kind of a small place but i guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids .
