we , there were four of us , arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude .

they never brought us complimentary noodles , ignored repeated requests for sugar , and threw our dishes on the table .

the food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny .

the duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world .

i was very disappointed with this restaurant .
0 1 2 5 6 10 11 23 24 28 29 33 34 44 44 45
ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away .

chow fun was dry ; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family .

the food is very average ... the thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet , every thing they serve is too sweet here .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 16 17 24 24 27 27 30 31 35 36 42 43 48 49 51 52 53 54 57 58 61 62 67 67 68 69 74 75 80 81 85 86 91 92 94 95 98 99 104 105 109 109 110
the only thing i moderately enjoyed was their grilled chicken special with edamame puree .
0 3 4 8 9 14 15 16 17 27 28 35 36 39 40 45 46 53 54 61 62 69 70 74 75 82 83 88 88 89
i had never had edamame pureed before but i thought it was innovative and tasty -lrb- could 've used a bit more salt -rrb- .
0 1 2 5 6 11 12 15 16 23 24 30 31 37 38 41 42 43 44 51 52 54 55 58 59 69 70 73 74 79 80 81 81 86 86 89 90 94 95 96 97 100 101 105 106 110 110 111 111 112
anyways , if you 're in the neighborhood to eat good food , i would n't waste my time trying to find something , rather go across the street to tamari .

the decor is night tho ... but they really need to clean that vent in the ceiling ... its quite un-appetizing , and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern .

we ate outside at haru 's sake bar because haru 's restaurant next door was overflowing .

what 's the difference between the two ?
0 4 4 6 7 10 11 21 22 29 30 33 34 37 37 38
their sake list was extensive , but we were looking for purple haze , which was n't listed but made for us upon request !

the spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome , great appetizer to share !

do n't judge this place prima facie , you have to try it to believe it , a home away from home for the literate heart .

i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect , which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me , i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water , or the check .

i tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose .
0 1 2 6 7 9 10 15 16 17 18 23 24 34 35 37 38 41 42 45 46 52 52 53 54 59 60 63 64 72 73 75 76 81 82 86 86 87
it melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy , creamy , and slightly buttery .
0 2 3 9 10 12 13 15 16 22 23 28 29 32 33 36 37 44 45 60 61 64 65 70 70 71 72 78 78 79 80 83 84 92 93 100 100 101
the sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned .
0 3 4 9 10 16 17 23 24 29 30 33 34 37 38 48 49 61 61 62
the rice to fish ration was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 16 17 23 24 27 28 32 33 37 37 39 39 43 44 47 47 50 51 54 55 57 58 66 67 70 71 75 75 76
we took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it .
0 2 3 7 8 18 19 21 22 25 26 30 31 36 37 42 43 47 48 50 51 59 60 62 63 65 66 69 70 74 75 80 81 83 83 84
i went to this restaurant with a woman that i met recently .
0 1 2 6 7 9 10 14 15 25 26 30 31 32 33 38 39 43 44 45 46 49 50 58 58 59
she lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy .

surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth .
0 12 13 20 21 26 27 29 30 37 38 42 43 46 47 52 52 53
in the evening , this place attracted a well dressed , with it , ny crowd .

having hunted around for a quiet , romantic , yet not hideously expensive restaurant i stumbled across reviews for la lanterna and gave it a shot .
0 6 7 13 14 20 21 24 25 26 27 32 32 33 34 42 42 43 44 47 48 51 52 61 62 71 72 82 83 84 85 93 94 100 101 108 109 112 113 115 116 124 125 128 129 133 134 136 137 138 139 143 143 144
quite simply it 's like stepping out of manhattan and into a haven of tranquility .

the service was attentive , yet unimposing , the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced .
0 3 4 11 12 15 16 25 25 26 27 30 31 41 41 42 43 46 47 51 52 55 56 59 60 66 67 71 72 76 77 86 87 98 99 101 102 109 110 113 114 117 118 122 123 127 128 130 131 140 141 144 145 149 150 156 156 157
the prix fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough -lrb- both in quantity and quality -rrb- .
0 3 4 8 9 13 14 18 19 21 22 27 28 33 34 39 40 43 44 47 48 51 52 56 57 61 62 68 69 70 70 74 75 77 78 86 87 90 91 98 98 99 99 100
i will be going back and heartily recommend it !

i 've had the lunch buffet at chennai a couple of times , when i have been in the neighborhood .
0 1 1 4 5 8 9 12 13 18 19 25 26 28 29 36 37 38 39 45 46 48 49 54 54 55 56 60 61 62 63 67 68 72 73 75 76 79 80 92 92 93
it is terrific , as is the value .
0 2 3 5 6 14 14 15 16 18 19 21 22 25 26 31 31 32
$ 6 and there is much tasty food , all of it fresh and continually refilled .
0 1 1 2 3 6 7 12 13 15 16 20 21 26 27 31 31 32 33 36 37 39 40 42 43 48 49 52 53 64 65 73 73 74
i am not a vegetarian but , almost all the dishes were great .
0 1 2 4 5 8 9 10 11 21 22 25 25 26 27 33 34 37 38 41 42 48 49 53 54 59 59 60
frankly , when you compare what you can have here for lunch , versus mcds or so many other sandwich shops in the city , there is no comparison .
0 7 7 8 9 13 14 17 18 25 26 30 31 34 35 38 39 43 44 48 49 52 53 58 58 59 60 66 67 71 72 74 75 77 78 82 83 88 89 97 98 103 104 106 107 110 111 115 115 116 117 122 123 125 126 128 129 139 139 140
go hungry and enjoy .
0 2 3 9 10 13 14 19 19 20
the food here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it .
0 3 4 8 9 13 14 16 17 23 24 28 28 29 30 33 34 38 39 41 42 45 46 50 51 53 54 58 59 62 63 65 65 66
i like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing .
0 1 2 6 7 10 11 18 18 19 20 24 24 25 26 29 30 33 34 39 39 40 41 44 45 48 49 55 56 59 60 64 65 69 70 75 76 89 89 90
the service varys from day to day - sometimes they 're very nice , and sometimes not .
0 3 4 11 12 17 18 22 23 26 27 29 30 33 33 34 35 44 45 49 49 52 53 57 58 62 62 63 64 67 68 77 78 81 81 82
the kitchen however , is almost always slow .
0 3 4 11 12 19 19 20 21 23 24 30 31 37 38 42 42 43
also , specify if you like your food spicy - its rather bland if you do n't .
0 4 4 5 6 13 14 16 17 20 21 25 26 30 31 35 36 41 41 42 43 46 47 53 54 59 60 62 63 66 67 69 69 72 72 73
the ambience is pretty and nice for conversation , so a casual lunch here would probably be best .
0 3 4 12 13 15 16 22 23 26 27 31 32 35 36 48 48 49 50 52 53 54 55 61 62 67 68 72 73 78 79 87 88 90 91 95 95 96
just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday .

if you 've ever been along the river in weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer .
0 2 3 6 6 9 10 14 15 19 20 25 26 29 30 35 36 38 39 48 49 52 53 57 58 60 61 65 66 68 69 72 73 76 77 79 80 84 85 88 89 94 95 100 101 104 105 107 108 113 113 114
add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .
0 3 4 6 7 11 12 17 18 25 26 29 30 35 36 40 41 43 44 45 46 56 57 62 63 66 67 70 71 75 76 84 85 88 89 98 99 101 102 103 104 109 110 117 117 118
the lava cake dessert was incredible and i recommend it .

once you step into cosette , you 're miraculously in a small , off-the-beaten path parisian bistro .
0 4 5 8 9 13 14 18 19 26 26 27 28 31 31 34 35 47 48 50 51 52 53 58 58 59 60 74 75 79 80 88 89 95 95 96
this tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets , with that certain parisian flair .
0 4 5 9 10 20 21 23 24 26 27 31 32 34 35 37 38 42 42 43 44 48 49 53 54 61 62 70 71 76 76 77
the food was average to above-average ; the french onion soup filling yet not overly impressive , and the desserts not brilliant in any way .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 20 21 23 24 37 37 38 39 42 43 49 50 55 56 60 61 68 69 72 73 76 77 83 84 94 94 95 96 99 100 103 104 112 113 116 117 126 127 129 130 133 134 137 137 138
however , go for the ambience , and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world !
0 7 7 8 9 11 12 15 16 19 20 28 28 29 30 33 34 42 43 46 47 51 52 56 57 58 59 68 69 72 73 74 75 79 80 86 87 90 91 96 96 97
i have never eaten in the restaurant , however , upon reading the reviews i got take out last week .
0 1 2 6 7 12 13 18 19 21 22 25 26 36 36 37 38 45 45 46 47 51 52 59 60 63 64 71 72 73 74 77 78 82 83 86 87 91 92 96 96 97
it was horrible .
0 2 3 6 7 15 15 16
the pizza was delivered cold and the cheese was n't even fully melted !
0 3 4 9 10 13 14 23 24 28 29 32 33 36 37 43 44 47 47 50 51 55 56 61 62 68 68 69
it looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips .
0 2 3 9 10 14 15 23 24 30 31 37 38 42 43 44 45 50 51 53 54 60 60 61
i have eaten at many pizza places around nyc and this is hands down the worst .
0 1 2 6 7 12 13 15 16 20 21 26 27 33 34 40 41 44 45 48 49 53 54 56 57 62 63 67 68 71 72 77 77 78
this has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in brooklyn .
0 4 5 8 9 12 13 15 16 18 19 22 23 25 26 29 30 34 35 44 45 56 57 59 60 68 68 69
the pizza is overpriced and soggy .
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 23 24 27 28 33 33 34
yes , they use fancy ingredients , but even fancy ingredients do n't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .
0 3 3 4 5 9 10 13 14 19 20 31 31 32 33 36 37 41 42 47 48 59 60 62 62 65 66 70 71 74 75 79 80 85 86 92 93 100 101 106 107 110 111 113 114 117 118 121 122 127 128 133 133 134

the combination of super-fresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious .

as a japanese native , i 've lived in the tristate area for over 8 years , but i was just so amazed at this place .
0 2 3 4 5 13 14 20 20 21 22 23 23 26 27 32 33 35 36 39 40 48 49 53 54 57 58 62 63 64 65 70 70 71 72 75 76 77 78 81 82 86 87 89 90 96 97 99 100 104 105 110 110 111

this place is worth an one-hour drive .
0 4 5 10 11 13 14 19 20 22 23 31 32 37 37 38
i am so coming back here again , as much as i can .

you 'll pay at least double at any other italian restaurant in the city , and most still do n't compare .

this place is incredibly tiny .
0 4 5 10 11 13 14 24 25 29 29 30
they refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends .

we went to ino for valentines .

0 3 4 9 10 12 13 18 19 22 23 24 25 29 30 33 34 44 44 45
but the pizza is way to expensive .
0 3 4 7 8 13 14 16 17 20 21 23 24 33 33 34
a large is $ 20 , and toppings are about $ 3 each .

0 3 4 7 8 12 13 15 16 20 20 21
the one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side .
0 3 4 7 8 10 11 14 15 19 20 24 25 27 28 32 33 39 40 44 45 48 49 52 53 55 56 59 60 64 65 69 69 70

with the great variety on the menu , i eat here often and never get bored .
0 4 5 8 9 14 15 22 23 25 26 29 30 34 35 36 37 38 39 42 43 47 48 53 54 57 58 63 64 67 68 73 74 75
the atmosphere is n't the greatest , but i suppose that 's how they keep the prices down .
0 3 4 14 15 17 17 20 21 24 25 33 34 35 36 39 40 41 42 49 50 54 54 56 57 60 61 65 66 70 71 74 75 81 82 86 87 88

0 2 2 4 5 8 9 14 15 18 19 23 24 26
i went there with my friend last saturday .
0 1 2 6 7 12 13 17 18 20 21 27 28 32 33 41 41 42
first it took us a long time to find the place .
0 5 6 8 9 13 14 16 17 18 19 23 24 28 29 31 32 36 37 40 41 46 46 47
we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant , then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers .
0 2 3 7 8 13 14 17 18 22 23 27 28 30 31 34 35 37 38 41 42 52 52 53 54 58 59 61 62 65 66 70 71 73 74 79 80 88 89 99 99 100
but when we looked at the menu , there were n't a lot of choices , most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 18 19 21 22 25 26 30 30 31 32 37 38 42 42 45 46 47 48 51 52 54 55 62 62 63 64 68 69 71 72 76 77 81 82 91 92 94 95 98 99 108 109 116 116 117
then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi .
0 4 5 7 8 15 16 17 18 26 27 32 33 36 37 42 43 47 48 55 55 56
those rolls were big , but not good and sashimi was n't fresh .
0 5 6 11 12 16 17 20 20 21 22 25 26 29 30 34 35 38 39 46 47 50 50 53 54 59 59 60
they were dry and disgusting , i did n't even finish my first piece .
0 4 5 9 10 13 14 17 18 28 28 29 30 31 32 35 35 38 39 43 44 50 51 53 54 59 60 65 65 66
hurley 's is like cheers where everyone knows your name and they are actually glad you came .
0 6 6 8 9 11 12 16 17 23 24 29 30 38 39 44 45 49 50 54 55 58 59 63 64 67 68 76 77 81 82 85 86 90 90 91
try the crunchy tuna , it is to die for .
0 3 4 7 8 15 16 20 20 21 22 24 25 27 28 30 31 34 35 38 38 39
try everything for that matter , it is all good .
0 3 4 14 15 18 19 23 24 30 30 31 32 34 35 37 38 41 42 46 46 47
i have been going there since it opened and i ca n't get enough .
0 1 2 6 7 11 12 17 18 23 24 29 30 32 33 39 40 43 44 45 46 48 48 51 52 55 56 62 62 63
first went here to enjoy their garden terrace .
0 5 6 10 11 15 16 18 19 24 25 30 31 37 38 45 45 46
the food was amazing , and the service was prompt and helpful , but not over-bearing or rushed .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 20 20 21 22 25 26 29 30 37 38 41 42 48 49 52 53 60 60 61 62 65 66 69 70 82 83 85 86 92 92 93
the steak tartare is a great bet , they fix it for you at the table .
0 3 4 9 10 17 18 20 21 22 23 28 29 32 32 33 34 38 39 42 43 45 46 49 50 53 54 56 57 60 61 66 66 67
admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm , but the open kitchen is part of the charm .
0 10 11 15 16 22 23 29 30 33 34 44 45 49 50 56 57 61 61 62 63 66 67 70 71 75 76 83 84 86 87 91 92 94 95 98 99 104 104 105
great wine selection , gigondas is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value .
0 5 6 10 11 20 20 21 22 30 31 33 34 39 40 43 44 49 49 50 51 54 55 58 59 64 65 74 75 77 78 79 80 85 86 91 91 92
it may be a bit packed on weekends , but the vibe is good and it is the best french food you will find in the area .
0 2 3 6 7 9 10 11 12 15 16 22 23 25 26 34 34 35 36 39 40 43 44 48 49 51 52 56 57 60 61 63 64 66 67 70 71 75 76 82 83 87 88 91 92 96 97 101 102 104 105 108 109 113 113 114

pizza - the only pizza in nyc that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best , freshly baked bread !

0 1 1 3 4 10 11 20 21 23 24 27 28 29 30 37 38 46 47 49 50 52 53 61 62 65 66 74 75 82 83 86 87 91 92 99 99 100
i 'm not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and i all enjoy mizu very much ... and we 're repeat customers .
0 1 1 3 4 7 8 12 13 18 19 22 23 28 29 38 39 42 43 46 47 49 50 55 56 58 59 61 62 64 65 72 73 76 77 86 87 98 99 106 107 109 110 117 118 121 122 123 124 127 128 133 134 138 139 143 144 148 148 151 152 155 156 158 158 161 162 168 169 178 178 179

0 8 9 11 12 17 18 23 24 35 36 42 43 47 47 48 49 53 54 60 61 65 66 76 76 77
but too far east !
0 3 4 7 8 11 12 16 16 17
i live a block away and go to patsy 's frequently .

the pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap , frozen , shredded cheese common to most pizzaria 's .
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 22 23 24 25 29 30 33 34 39 40 50 51 58 59 61 62 65 66 71 71 72 73 79 79 80 81 89 90 96 97 103 104 106 107 111 112 120 120 122 122 123
two complaints - their appetizer selection stinks , it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu .
0 3 4 14 14 15 16 21 22 31 32 41 42 48 48 49 50 52 53 58 59 61 62 66 67 69 70 73 74 78 79 89 90 96 97 99 100 103 104 108 108 109
also , because it is so thin , it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling .
0 4 4 5 6 13 14 16 17 19 20 22 23 27 27 28 29 31 32 36 37 41 42 46 47 54 55 58 59 62 63 66 67 71 72 79 79 80
so eat fast and order a lot .
0 2 3 6 7 11 12 15 16 21 22 23 24 27 27 28
wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the uws !

by far the best salad i have had in a fast food restaurant .

on a recent sunday afternoon , a friend and i accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play doubt .
0 2 3 4 5 11 12 18 19 28 28 29 30 31 32 38 39 42 43 44 45 55 56 61 62 66 67 72 73 83 84 86 87 90 91 94 95 97 98 101 102 105 106 114 115 120 121 128 129 133 134 139 139 140
this was the perfect quiet , relaxing , and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater .
0 4 5 8 9 12 13 20 21 26 26 27 28 36 36 37 38 41 42 51 52 65 66 68 69 72 73 82 83 85 86 93 93 94
the chicken pot pie is excpetiona , the cheeseburger huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm .
0 3 4 11 12 15 16 19 20 22 23 33 33 34 35 38 39 51 52 56 57 60 61 71 71 72 73 76 77 80 81 88 89 101 102 105 106 110 110 111
with so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district , is truly an excellent find !
0 4 5 7 8 12 13 17 18 29 30 32 33 35 36 39 40 42 43 46 47 54 55 63 63 64 65 67 68 73 74 76 77 86 87 91 91 92
we will return many times for this oasis in mid-town .

i grew up on these bagels .
0 1 2 6 7 9 10 12 13 18 19 25 25 26
the staff is no nonsense .
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 15 16 24 24 25
the food options rule .
0 3 4 8 9 16 17 21 21 22
when i lived upstate for a while i would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else .
0 4 5 6 7 12 13 20 21 24 25 26 27 32 33 34 35 40 41 44 45 51 52 55 56 62 63 66 67 71 72 77 78 83 84 86 87 93 94 98 99 102 103 107 107 108
worth visiting the 1st ave spot because it is the original store .
0 5 6 14 15 18 19 22 23 26 27 31 32 39 40 42 43 45 46 49 50 58 59 64 64 65
i stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two fridays ago when i was with two friends in town from l.a.
0 1 2 10 11 15 16 20 21 27 28 33 34 41 42 45 46 53 54 57 58 62 63 64 65 68 69 73 74 77 78 85 86 88 89 93 94 98 99 103
being serious sushi lovers , we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action .
0 5 6 13 14 19 20 26 26 27 28 30 31 34 35 37 38 41 42 47 48 51 52 54 55 57 58 64 65 67 68 71 72 78 78 79
i asked the chef what he recommends and he asked me if i like uni . -lrb-
0 1 2 7 8 11 12 16 17 21 22 24 25 35 36 39 40 42 43 48 49 51 52 54 55 56 57 61 62 65 65 66 67 68
for those of you who do n't know , uni is sea urchin in japanese , which happens to be my favorite . -rrb-
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 16 17 20 21 23 23 26 27 31 31 32 33 36 37 39 40 43 44 50 51 53 54 62 62 63 64 69 70 77 78 80 81 83 84 86 87 95 95 96 96 97
he served me an uni hand roll , which i never had before , and let me tell you ... it was heaven !
0 2 3 9 10 12 13 15 16 19 20 24 25 29 29 30 31 36 37 38 39 44 45 48 49 55 55 56 57 60 61 64 65 67 68 72 73 76 76 79 79 81 82 85 86 92 92 93
aside from the sea urchin , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including fatty yellow tail , boton shrimp , blue fin torro -lrb- fatty tuna -rrb- , sea eel , etc. .
0 5 6 10 11 14 15 18 19 25 25 26 27 30 31 35 36 47 48 50 51 61 62 64 65 69 70 79 80 85 86 92 93 97 97 98 99 104 105 111 111 112 113 117 118 121 122 127 128 129 129 134 135 139 139 140 140 141 142 145 146 149 149 150 151 154 154 155
the sake menu should not be overlooked !
0 3 4 8 9 13 14 20 21 24 25 27 28 38 38 39
all in all , this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city .
0 3 4 6 7 10 10 11 12 16 17 24 25 28 29 38 39 45 46 49 50 52 53 55 56 64 65 70 71 82 83 85 86 89 90 94 94 95

we visited orsay during ny restaurant week and tried their $ 35 menu .
0 2 3 10 11 16 17 23 24 26 27 37 38 42 43 46 47 52 53 58 59 60 60 62 63 67 67 68
service was very good - prompt , attentive and non-intrusive .
0 7 8 11 12 16 17 21 22 23 24 30 30 31 32 41 42 45 46 59 59 60
food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection -lrb- though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience -rrb- .
0 4 5 8 9 13 14 18 19 21 22 26 26 27 28 39 40 44 45 47 48 53 54 57 58 64 65 74 75 76 76 82 83 84 85 89 90 93 94 98 99 104 105 109 110 111 112 119 120 123 124 131 132 133 134 137 138 144 144 145 146 148 149 153 154 157 158 161 162 166 167 169 170 171 172 190 191 201 201 202 202 203
wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top .
0 4 5 9 10 19 20 22 23 27 28 31 32 49 50 53 54 64 65 71 72 74 75 78 79 82 82 83
traditional french decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .
0 11 12 18 19 25 26 29 30 38 39 45 46 49 50 54 55 58 59 65 66 71 72 73 74 77 78 88 89 92 93 97 98 101 102 104 105 108 109 111 112 117 118 121 122 128 129 131 132 134 135 139 140 142 143 151 152 153 154 166 166 167
i 've been to at cafe spice probably 5-8 times , it is probably still the best indian restaurant around union square .
0 1 1 4 5 9 10 12 13 15 16 20 21 26 27 35 36 39 40 45 45 46 47 49 50 52 53 61 62 67 68 71 72 76 77 83 84 94 95 101 102 107 108 114 114 115
to sum it up : service varies from good to mediorce , depending on which waiter you get ; generally it is just average ok .
0 2 3 6 7 9 10 12 12 13 14 21 22 28 29 33 34 38 39 41 42 50 50 51 52 61 62 64 65 70 71 77 78 81 82 85 85 86 87 96 97 99 100 102 103 107 108 115 116 118 118 119
seating is always prompt , though the restaurant does fill up in the evening .
0 7 8 10 11 17 18 24 24 25 26 32 33 36 37 47 48 52 53 57 58 60 61 63 64 67 68 75 75 76
food is usually very good , though ocasionally i wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders .
0 4 5 7 8 15 16 20 21 25 25 26 27 33 34 45 46 47 48 56 57 62 63 72 73 75 76 79 80 90 91 93 94 98 99 105 105 106
as many other reviewers noticed , your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time .
0 2 3 7 8 13 14 23 24 31 31 32 33 37 38 43 44 46 47 52 53 57 58 60 61 67 68 69 70 74 75 77 78 90 91 95 96 98 99 102 103 110 111 114 115 117 118 121 122 123 124 131 132 138 139 144 145 149 149 150
the decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date .
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 20 21 24 25 37 38 42 43 50 51 63 64 69 70 72 73 76 77 82 83 87 88 90 91 94 95 101 102 106 106 107 108 113 114 117 118 123 124 127 128 129 130 134 134 135

if we were to move from the upper east side , we would genuinely miss this restaurant .
0 2 3 5 6 10 11 13 14 18 19 23 24 27 28 33 34 38 39 43 43 44 45 47 48 53 54 63 64 68 69 73 74 84 84 85

the restaurant is cute but not upscale .
0 3 4 14 15 17 18 22 23 26 27 30 31 38 38 39
the food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes .

0 2 3 7 8 11 12 25 26 28 29 32 33 38 39 42 43 45 46 50 51 57 58 61 61 62
the bagel was huge .
0 3 4 9 10 13 14 18 18 19
they were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior .
0 4 5 9 10 16 17 21 22 25 26 29 30 31 32 36 37 43 44 52 52 53
the workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese -lrb- gets a little messy -rrb- .
0 3 4 11 12 17 18 22 23 33 34 38 39 42 43 48 49 53 54 59 60 66 67 68 68 72 73 74 75 81 82 87 87 88 88 89
i loved it and would highly recommend .
0 1 2 7 8 10 11 14 15 20 21 27 28 37 37 38
this was my frist time at cafe st. bart 's and i must say how delicous the food and the service was .
0 4 5 8 9 11 12 17 18 22 23 25 26 30 31 34 35 39 39 41 42 45 46 47 48 52 53 56 57 60 61 69 70 73 74 78 79 82 83 86 87 94 95 98 98 99
when i called this morning , i did n't think i would be able to get in at 12 , but i was able to get in , along with four other guests .
0 4 5 6 7 13 14 18 19 26 26 27 28 29 30 33 33 36 37 42 43 44 45 50 51 53 54 58 59 61 62 65 66 68 69 71 72 74 74 75 76 79 80 81 82 85 86 90 91 93 94 97 98 100 100 101 102 107 108 112 113 117 118 123 124 130 130 131
i have to highly recommend the lobster roll - not to much mayo ; you can tell it was a fresh lobster .
0 1 2 6 7 9 10 16 17 26 27 30 31 38 39 43 44 45 46 49 50 52 53 57 58 62 62 63 64 67 68 71 72 76 77 79 80 83 84 85 86 91 92 99 99 100
other guests enjoyed pizza , santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips .
0 5 6 12 13 20 21 26 26 27 28 33 34 36 37 44 45 50 51 54 55 59 60 63 64 69 69 70
i highly recommend cafe st. bart 's for their food , the ambience and wonderful service .
0 1 2 8 9 18 19 23 24 27 28 32 32 34 35 38 39 44 45 49 49 50 51 54 55 63 64 67 68 77 78 85 85 86
all the staff is absolutely professional !!
0 3 4 7 8 13 14 16 17 27 28 40 40 42
i sometimes see the waiters do n't have enough knowledge of their dishes .
0 1 2 11 12 15 16 19 20 27 28 30 30 33 34 38 39 45 46 55 56 58 59 64 65 71 71 72
but they do .
0 3 4 8 9 11 11 12
-lrb- that is a must , but not every restaurant can do ... -rrb-
0 1 1 5 6 8 9 10 11 15 15 16 17 20 21 24 25 30 31 41 42 45 46 48 48 51 51 52
if you want to dine with large party , i recommend to make reservation basement .
0 2 3 6 7 11 12 14 15 19 20 24 25 30 31 36 36 37 38 39 40 49 50 52 53 57 58 69 70 78 78 79
there 's nice and quiet , small but enough for 6 -lrb- or more -rrb- .
0 5 5 7 8 12 13 16 17 22 22 23 24 29 30 33 34 40 41 44 45 46 47 48 48 50 51 55 55 56 56 57
this restaurant was way overhyped .
0 4 5 15 16 19 20 23 24 33 33 34
my chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily .
0 2 3 7 8 11 12 15 16 20 21 24 25 28 29 35 36 41 42 45 46 50 50 51
okay-i do n't mind the oily part -lrb- cause most are cooked that way -rrb- but it was way too bland .
0 6 7 9 9 12 13 17 18 21 22 26 27 31 32 33 33 38 39 43 44 47 48 54 55 59 60 63 63 64 65 68 69 71 72 75 76 79 80 83 84 89 89 90
the scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary .
0 3 4 12 13 21 22 25 26 31 32 41 42 46 47 54 55 58 59 61 62 65 66 74 74 75
the service was the only thing good about this restaurant .
0 3 4 11 12 15 16 19 20 24 25 30 31 35 36 41 42 46 47 57 57 58
it 's boring on the inside , and our sushi was pretty below average ... the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor .
0 2 2 4 5 11 12 14 15 18 19 25 25 26 27 30 31 34 35 40 41 44 45 51 52 57 58 65 65 68 69 72 73 77 78 81 82 87 88 91 92 95 96 101 102 107 108 111 112 114 115 121 121 122
i definitely would n't go back .

there are many thai places in the city but so far toons is # 1 .
0 5 6 9 10 14 15 19 20 26 27 29 30 33 34 38 39 42 43 45 46 49 50 55 56 58 59 60 60 61 61 62
their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic .
0 5 6 9 10 16 17 19 20 29 30 33 34 44 45 49 50 52 53 62 62 63
the price is reasonable although the service is poor .
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 23 24 32 33 36 37 44 45 47 48 52 52 53
fresh restaurant was amazing ... . food was delicious and of course fresh .

great for a romantic evening , or a fun evening with friends ...
0 5 6 9 10 11 12 20 21 28 28 29 30 32 33 34 35 38 39 46 47 51 52 59 59 62

0 4 5 7 8 11 12 16 17 21 21 22
hats off to the chef .
0 4 5 8 9 11 12 15 16 20 20 21
i am not the most experienced person when it comes to thai food , but my friend who took me there is .
0 1 2 4 5 8 9 12 13 17 18 29 30 36 37 41 42 44 45 50 51 53 54 58 59 63 63 64 65 68 69 71 72 78 79 82 83 87 88 90 91 96 97 99 99 100

0 2 3 6 7 14 15 23 24 27 28 30 31 36 37 43 44 46 47 50 51 58 58 59
it was wonderful .
0 2 3 6 7 16 16 17
the salads are delicious , both refreshing and very spicy .

we had pam 's special fried fish and it was amazing .
0 2 3 6 7 10 10 12 13 20 21 26 27 31 32 35 36 38 39 42 43 50 50 51
too large for just two people but nothing was left .
0 3 4 9 10 13 14 18 19 22 23 29 30 33 34 41 42 45 46 50 50 51

great vibe , lots of people .
0 5 6 10 10 11 12 16 17 19 20 26 26 27
my husband and i both ordered the steak , medium .
0 2 3 10 11 14 15 16 17 21 22 29 30 33 34 39 39 40 41 47 47 48
my husbands was perfect , my was well done and dry .
0 2 3 11 12 15 16 23 23 24 25 27 28 31 32 36 37 41 42 45 46 49 49 50
i did n't complain , i liked the atmosphere so much .
0 1 2 5 5 8 9 17 17 18 19 20 21 26 27 30 31 41 42 44 45 49 49 50
will give it another chance before i write it off .
0 4 5 9 10 12 13 20 21 27 28 34 35 36 37 42 43 45 46 49 49 50
visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews .
0 7 8 13 14 19 20 22 23 31 32 35 36 43 44 47 48 55 55 56
on a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch .
0 2 3 4 5 8 9 12 13 15 16 19 20 28 29 31 32 36 37 39 40 43 44 49 50 55 55 56
ambience is so cute and quaint , good for business although we were there on vacation .
0 8 9 11 12 14 15 19 20 23 24 30 30 31 32 36 37 40 41 49 50 58 59 61 62 66 67 72 73 75 76 84 84 85
salads were fantastic .
0 6 7 11 12 21 21 22
although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great .
0 8 9 11 12 16 17 24 25 28 29 36 37 44 45 48 49 53 54 61 62 65 66 72 73 75 76 79 80 84 85 90 90 91
ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me .
0 11 12 15 16 23 24 29 30 32 33 34 35 39 40 44 45 48 49 51 51 52
we will be back .
0 2 3 7 8 10 11 15 15 16
this is some really good , inexpensive sushi .
0 4 5 7 8 12 13 19 20 24 24 25 26 37 38 43 43 44
it costs $ 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll , but the roll more than triples in size , and that 's not just from the rice .
0 2 3 8 9 10 10 11 12 17 18 20 21 25 26 27 28 35 36 40 41 45 46 48 49 59 60 64 64 65 66 69 70 73 74 78 79 83 84 88 89 96 97 99 100 104 104 105 106 109 110 114 114 116 117 120 121 125 126 130 131 134 135 139 139 140
the spicy tuna roll is huge and probably the best that i 've had at this price range .
0 3 4 9 10 14 15 19 20 22 23 27 28 31 32 40 41 44 45 49 50 54 55 56 56 59 60 63 64 66 67 71 72 77 78 83 83 84
the yellowtail was particularly good as well .
0 3 4 14 15 18 19 31 32 36 37 39 40 44 44 45
i have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .
0 1 2 6 7 19 20 25 26 29 30 33 34 37 38 41 42 45 46 50 50 51 52 59 60 62 63 66 67 74 75 78 79 85 86 93 94 97 98 101 102 105 106 114 115 120 121 125 126 130 131 135 136 139 140 143 144 147 148 151 152 156 157 161 162 163 163 165 166 168 169 173 174 179 180 183 184 187 188 192 192 193
in any event , this is a place i 'll be sure to stop by again when i 'm in this part of town .
0 2 3 6 7 12 12 13 14 18 19 21 22 23 24 29 30 31 31 34 35 37 38 42 43 45 46 50 51 53 54 59 60 64 65 66 66 68 69 71 72 76 77 81 82 84 85 89 89 90
big wong gets big ups for a fine establishment .
0 3 4 8 9 13 14 17 18 21 22 25 26 27 28 32 33 46 46 47
they have it all -- great price , food , and service .
0 4 5 9 10 12 13 16 17 19 20 25 26 31 31 32 33 37 37 38 39 42 43 50 50 51
the atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .
0 3 4 14 15 17 18 23 24 27 28 31 32 39 40 43 44 53 54 61 62 68 69 74 75 81 82 84 85 89 90 92 93 97 98 101 101 102
the food is prepared quickly and efficiently .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 20 21 28 29 32 33 44 44 45
and it all comes at a very reasonable price -lrb- congee , noodles , and rice dishes are no more than $ 3-6 each -rrb- .
0 3 4 6 7 10 11 16 17 19 20 21 22 26 27 37 38 43 44 45 45 51 51 52 53 60 60 61 62 65 66 70 71 77 78 81 82 84 85 89 90 94 95 96 96 99 100 104 104 105 105 106
the takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well .
0 3 4 11 12 14 15 20 21 24 25 30 31 35 36 40 41 45 46 53 54 64 65 67 68 72 72 73
this place is always very crowded and popular .
0 4 5 10 11 13 14 20 21 25 26 33 34 37 38 45 45 46
went here on a friend 's reccomendation .
0 4 5 9 10 12 13 14 15 21 21 23 24 38 38 39
enjoyed a very nice caesar salad while my wife had arugula and goat cheese ... both very tasty .
0 7 8 9 10 14 15 19 20 26 27 32 33 38 39 41 42 46 47 50 51 58 59 62 63 67 68 74 74 78 78 82 83 87 88 93 93 94
we both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh .
0 2 3 7 8 13 14 17 18 19 20 25 26 30 31 34 35 39 40 44 45 51 52 58 59 62 63 68 68 69
we concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake , both were delicious .
0 2 3 12 13 17 18 26 27 36 37 41 41 42 43 47 48 52 53 62 62 63

i recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time .
0 1 2 10 11 15 16 18 19 23 24 34 35 39 40 44 45 55 56 59 60 65 66 69 70 73 74 76 77 84 85 89 89 90

we even had a visit from the manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves .
0 2 3 7 8 11 12 13 14 19 20 24 25 28 29 36 37 40 41 47 48 50 51 55 56 60 61 63 64 68 69 77 78 87 87 88
yes , the prices are high , but i felt it was worth it .
0 3 3 4 5 8 9 15 16 19 20 24 24 25 26 29 30 31 32 36 37 39 40 43 44 49 50 52 52 53
we all felt it was worth it .
0 2 3 6 7 11 12 14 15 18 19 24 25 27 27 28
sometimes i get good food and ok service .
0 9 10 11 12 15 16 20 21 25 26 29 30 32 33 40 40 41
sometimes i get bad food and bad service , sometimes i get good good and bad service .

it is not consistent .
0 2 3 5 6 9 10 20 20 21
really depends on your luck !
0 6 7 14 15 17 18 22 23 27 27 28
the place is a bistro which means : simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere .
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 14 15 21 22 27 28 33 33 34 35 41 42 48 49 52 53 57 58 64 65 76 77 79 80 81 82 90 91 101 101 102
and where does patis go wrong ; no where .
0 3 4 9 10 14 15 20 21 23 24 29 29 30 31 33 34 39 39 40
you are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but : cassuolet , steake fritte , tripe stew , etc ; simple stuff .
0 3 4 7 8 11 12 18 19 23 24 31 32 36 37 43 44 49 50 52 53 61 62 65 65 66 67 76 76 77 78 84 85 91 91 92 93 98 99 103 103 104 105 108 108 109 110 116 117 122 122 123
and evaluated on those terms pastis is simply wonderful .
0 3 4 13 14 16 17 22 23 28 29 35 36 38 39 45 46 55 55 56
right off the l in brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza .

mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta -lrb- raddichio was kind of bitter though -rrb- .

my friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better .

the sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day .

kind of a small place but i guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids .

coming from boston this place is like emma 's pizza in kendall square in cambridge -lrb- although they have more funky toppings ! -rrb-

the hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed .
0 3 4 10 11 16 17 20 21 25 26 32 33 36 37 40 41 45 46 49 50 60 61 64 65 67 68 75 76 78 79 85 86 90 91 93 94 97 98 102 103 107 108 114 114 115

do not try unless you 're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste .

0 1 2 12 13 17 18 22 23 28 28 31
from the street it looks very hidden , and is actually an old warehouse .
0 4 5 8 9 15 16 18 19 24 25 29 30 36 36 37 38 41 42 44 45 53 54 56 57 60 61 70 70 71

we ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the thai section of the menu but nothing we got was thai .
0 2 3 10 11 15 16 20 21 24 25 31 32 36 37 43 44 48 49 52 53 57 58 65 66 68 69 72 73 77 78 81 82 89 90 92 93 96 97 100 101 105 105 106
we were very disappointed .
0 2 3 7 8 12 13 25 25 26
we wo n't go to this place again for a good meal .
0 2 3 5 5 8 9 11 12 14 15 19 20 25 26 31 32 35 36 37 38 42 43 47 47 48
however , i think this place is a good hang out spot .
0 7 7 8 9 10 11 16 17 21 22 27 28 30 31 32 33 37 38 42 43 46 47 51 51 52
next time , we would n't dare ordering anything else other than some simple asian appetizers and drinks .

my girlfriend and i stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time !
0 2 3 13 14 17 18 19 20 28 29 33 34 38 39 46 47 52 53 56 57 62 63 68 69 72 73 76 77 78 79 84 85 89 89 90
the pizza and wine were excellent-the service too -- but what really made this place was the backyard dining area .
0 3 4 9 10 13 14 18 19 23 24 37 38 45 46 49 49 51 51 54 55 59 60 66 67 71 72 76 77 82 83 86 87 90 91 99 100 106 107 111 111 112
it is one the nicest outdoor restaurants i have ever seen in ny -- i am from italy and this place rivals the ones in my country .
0 2 3 5 6 9 10 13 14 20 21 28 29 40 41 42 43 47 48 52 53 57 58 60 61 63 63 65 65 66 67 69 70 74 75 80 81 84 85 89 90 95 96 102 103 106 107 111 112 114 115 117 118 125 125 126
they tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter , so i 'm looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it .
0 4 5 9 10 12 13 17 18 21 22 27 28 30 31 36 37 40 41 47 48 50 51 56 57 60 61 64 65 71 71 72 73 75 76 77 77 79 80 87 88 95 96 98 99 104 105 110 111 113 114 115 116 121 122 127 128 130 131 136 137 139 139 140
check this place out !
0 5 6 10 11 16 17 20 20 21
highly recommended !!!!!
0 6 7 18 18 23
first of all , this place is * not * romantic , as claimed by citysearch 's editorial review .
0 5 6 8 9 12 12 13 14 18 19 24 25 27 28 29 29 32 32 33 34 42 42 43 44 46 47 54 55 57 58 68 68 70 71 80 81 87 87 88
either that , or the editor 's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th .
0 6 7 11 11 12 13 15 16 19 20 26 26 28 29 33 34 36 37 44 45 49 50 52 53 60 61 62 63 75 76 80 81 84 85 89 90 95 95 96 97 102 103 109 110 112 113 118 119 125 126 130 131 134 135 142 143 145 146 150 150 151
the tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .
0 3 4 10 11 14 15 22 23 26 27 30 31 36 36 37 38 41 42 46 47 49 50 57 58 60 61 64 65 72 73 83 83 84 85 88 89 92 93 97 98 102 103 105 106 112 113 123 123 124
slightly above average wines start at $ 70 + with only one selection listed at $ 30 + .
0 8 9 14 15 22 23 28 29 34 35 37 38 39 39 41 41 42 43 47 48 52 53 56 57 66 67 73 74 76 77 78 78 80 80 81 81 82
service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category .
0 7 8 10 11 14 15 19 20 23 24 29 30 36 37 41 42 43 44 49 50 52 53 57 58 63 64 72 72 73
for instance , plates were just dumped on the table , i was handed the wine list upside down , etc. ...
0 3 4 12 12 13 14 20 21 25 26 30 31 37 38 40 41 44 45 50 50 51 52 53 54 57 58 64 65 68 69 73 74 78 79 85 86 90 90 91 92 96 96 99
somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service .
0 7 8 15 16 19 20 27 28 33 34 38 39 47 48 53 54 60 61 65 66 69 70 80 81 87 88 95 95 96
to be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora .
0 2 3 5 6 16 17 21 21 22 23 26 27 31 32 41 42 48 49 52 53 56 57 61 61 62 63 68 69 72 73 78 79 86 86 87 88 91 92 97 97 100 101 105 106 108 109 112 113 116 117 120 121 126 127 139 140 142 143 150 150 151

not one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring .
0 3 4 7 8 10 11 14 15 20 21 24 25 31 32 33 34 39 40 46 47 51 52 56 57 62 63 71 72 74 75 81 82 91 91 92

if you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo .
0 2 3 6 7 11 12 17 18 22 23 26 27 30 31 38 39 47 47 48
it 's very spicy but not offensive .
0 2 2 4 5 9 10 15 16 19 20 23 24 33 33 34
we will definitely go back .
0 2 3 7 8 18 19 21 22 26 26 27

0 2 3 5 6 12 13 16 17 20 21 26 27 34 35 38 39 47 48 52 52 53
the portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter .

the wine list is excellent .
0 3 4 8 9 13 14 16 17 26 26 27
the food is amazing ... especially if you get the chef 's tasting menu and your favourite bottle -lrb- or two ! -rrb- of wine from an extensive selection of wines .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 19 19 22 23 33 34 36 37 40 41 44 45 48 49 53 53 55 56 63 64 68 69 72 73 77 78 87 88 94 95 96 96 98 99 102 102 103 103 104 105 107 108 112 113 117 118 120 121 130 131 140 141 143 144 149 149 150
the place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the service is excellent and it 's great for friends out , a romantic date , or a special occassion .

the food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you do n't like .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 16 17 23 24 27 28 31 32 37 38 42 43 50 51 55 56 58 59 62 63 71 72 76 77 80 81 82 83 87 88 93 94 97 98 102 103 108 109 112 113 117 118 120 121 124 125 129 130 139 140 142 143 147 148 151 152 154 154 157 158 162 162 163

with the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering , the food here was decent , not great .
0 4 5 8 9 18 19 21 22 25 26 31 32 37 38 42 43 46 47 49 50 54 55 61 62 64 65 67 68 72 73 76 77 81 82 89 90 98 98 99 100 103 104 108 109 113 114 117 118 124 124 125 126 129 130 135 135 136
the menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 16 17 24 25 26 27 28 29 34 35 37 38 45 46 47 48 50 51 52 53 60 60 61
we ordered the special , grilled branzino , that was so infused with bone , it was difficult to eat .
0 2 3 10 11 14 15 22 22 23 24 31 32 40 40 41 42 46 47 50 51 53 54 61 62 66 67 71 71 72 73 75 76 79 80 89 90 92 93 96 96 97
the decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the east village - not romantic , just simple , small and sparse .
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 17 18 23 24 26 27 31 32 41 42 45 46 49 50 54 55 57 58 63 64 67 68 74 75 77 78 81 82 86 87 94 95 96 97 100 101 109 109 110 111 115 116 122 122 123 124 129 130 133 134 140 140 141
problem is nothing at prune is particularly memorable .
0 7 8 10 11 18 19 21 22 27 28 30 31 43 44 53 53 54
no plans to return anytime soon .
0 2 3 8 9 11 12 18 19 26 27 31 31 32
this place is so much fun .
0 4 5 10 11 13 14 16 17 21 22 25 25 26
our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant .
0 3 4 10 11 16 17 25 26 30 31 41 42 55 56 58 59 60 61 71 71 72
this place must have cost the owners afortune to build .
0 4 5 10 11 15 16 20 21 25 26 29 30 36 37 45 46 48 49 54 54 55
i think the stuff was better than disney .
0 1 2 7 8 11 12 17 18 21 22 28 29 33 34 40 40 41
our food was great too !
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 18 19 22 22 23
and really large portions .
0 3 4 10 11 16 17 25 25 26
the staff was the friendliest that have seen in new york .
0 3 4 9 10 13 14 17 18 29 30 34 35 39 40 44 45 47 48 51 52 56 56 57

if you want something really different than try jekyll and hyde .
0 2 3 6 7 11 12 21 22 28 29 38 39 43 44 47 48 54 55 58 59 63 63 64
it is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of disney type special effects .
0 2 3 5 6 7 8 11 12 14 15 18 19 23 24 28 29 42 43 46 47 50 51 56 57 59 60 66 67 71 72 79 80 87 87 88
the food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 19 20 29 30 33 34 36 37 40 41 44 45 48 49 53 54 58 59 64 65 73 73 74

my six year old loved it .
0 2 3 6 7 11 12 15 16 21 22 24 24 25
the characters really make for an enjoyable experience .
0 3 4 14 15 21 22 26 27 30 31 33 34 43 44 54 54 55
the food however , is what one might expect .
0 3 4 8 9 16 16 17 18 20 21 25 26 29 30 35 36 42 42 43
it is very overpriced and not very tasty .
0 2 3 5 6 10 11 21 22 25 26 29 30 34 35 40 40 41
however , i think jeckll and hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once .
0 7 7 8 9 10 11 16 17 23 24 27 28 33 34 35 36 38 39 42 43 45 46 51 52 58 59 63 64 66 67 70 71 73 74 76 77 81 81 82

0 2 3 6 7 8 9 13 14 18 18 19
went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them .
0 4 5 10 11 15 16 18 19 23 24 27 28 30 31 34 35 37 38 42 43 46 47 48 49 54 55 59 60 66 67 70 71 76 77 80 81 86 87 91 92 96 97 101 102 107 108 112 113 116 117 128 129 133 134 136 137 141 141 142

drinks way over priced .
0 6 7 10 11 15 16 22 22 23
food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
0 4 5 8 9 13 14 17 18 23 24 27 28 33 34 37 38 42 43 45 46 53 54 59

a little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite .
0 1 2 8 9 19 20 23 24 29 30 32 33 37 38 41 42 46 47 48 49 53 53 54
growing up in ny , i have eaten my share of bagels .
0 7 8 10 11 13 14 16 16 17 18 19 20 24 25 30 31 33 34 39 40 42 43 49 49 50
ess-a-bagel -lrb- either by sty-town or midtown -rrb- is by far the best bagel in ny .
0 11 12 13 13 19 20 22 23 31 32 34 35 42 42 43 44 46 47 49 50 53 54 57 58 62 63 68 69 71 72 74 74 75
the bagels always warm , soft on the inside , crispy on the outside and enormous in size .
0 3 4 10 11 17 18 22 22 23 24 28 29 31 32 35 36 42 42 43 44 50 51 53 54 57 58 65 66 69 70 78 79 81 82 86 86 87
they have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great .

i have to agree with the previous reviewer .
0 1 2 6 7 9 10 15 16 20 21 24 25 33 34 42 42 43
i do n't get it either .
0 1 2 4 4 7 8 11 12 14 15 21 21 22
not impressed with the food .
0 3 4 13 14 18 19 22 23 27 27 28
prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant .
0 6 7 10 11 15 16 19 20 24 25 32 33 36 37 48 49 58 58 59
zero ambiance to boot .
0 4 5 13 14 16 17 21 21 22
i thought this place was totally overrated .
0 1 2 9 10 14 15 20 21 24 25 32 33 42 42 43
everything we had was good or ok ... but definitely nothing great .
0 10 11 13 14 17 18 21 22 26 27 29 30 32 32 36 36 39 40 50 51 58 59 64 64 65
the ambience was nice , but service was n't so great .
0 3 4 12 13 16 17 21 21 22 23 26 27 34 35 38 38 41 42 44 45 50 50 51
when you add it all together , it just does n't seem worth it to me ... especially considering the prices .
0 4 5 8 9 12 13 15 16 19 20 28 28 29 30 32 33 37 38 42 42 45 46 50 51 56 57 59 60 62 63 65 65 68 68 78 79 90 91 94 95 101 101 102
this is the best shabu-shabu restaurant in the try-state area .
0 4 5 7 8 11 12 16 17 28 29 39 40 42 43 46 47 56 57 61 61 62

thius is a must for anyone who loves shabu-shabu .
0 5 6 8 9 10 11 15 16 19 20 26 27 30 31 36 37 48 48 49
the atmosphere is nothing special , but it feels like a sushi establishment in tokyo .
0 3 4 14 15 17 18 25 26 33 33 34 35 38 39 41 42 47 48 52 53 54 55 60 61 74 75 77 78 83 83 84
the owner and staff are all japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance .
0 3 4 9 10 13 14 19 20 23 24 27 28 36 37 39 40 44 45 48 49 53 54 58 59 61 62 65 66 72 73 81 81 82
despite a slightly limited menu , everything prepared is done to perfection , ultra fresh and a work of food art .

went there for an office lunch .
0 4 5 10 11 14 15 17 18 24 25 30 30 31
the location and ambience is ok but the food is what makes up for it .
0 3 4 12 13 16 17 25 26 28 29 31 32 35 36 39 40 44 45 47 48 52 53 58 59 61 62 65 66 68 68 69

try green curry with vegetables .
0 3 4 9 10 15 16 20 21 31 31 32
the quantity is also very good , you will come out satisfied .
0 3 4 12 13 15 16 20 21 25 26 30 30 31 32 35 36 40 41 45 46 49 50 59 59 60
the service is ok , some of the people did n't get what they asked for .
0 3 4 11 12 14 15 17 17 18 19 23 24 26 27 30 31 37 38 41 41 44 45 48 49 53 54 58 59 64 65 68 68 69

the wine the service was very good too .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 20 21 24 25 29 30 34 35 38 38 39
moderate prices .
0 8 9 15 15 16
a little noise but i think that was because of our party !
0 1 2 8 9 14 15 18 19 20 21 26 27 31 32 35 36 43 44 46 47 50 51 56 56 57

this quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my manhattan restaurant list .
0 4 5 11 12 15 16 24 25 34 35 37 38 40 41 44 45 48 49 51 52 54 55 64 65 75 76 80 80 81
the food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare , the dishes are never a disappointment .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 21 22 23 24 28 29 32 33 41 42 44 45 48 49 56 57 66 66 67 68 71 72 78 79 82 83 88 89 90 91 105 105 106
whether it 's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar , you will surely be transported to northern italy with one bite .

although the tables may be closely situated , the candle-light , food-quality and service overcompensate .
0 8 9 12 13 19 20 23 24 26 27 34 35 43 43 44 45 48 49 61 61 62 63 75 76 79 80 87 88 102 102 103

i have known about this secret for the last 13 years , emilio -lrb- the godfather -rrb- has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices .

the food was authentic .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 22 22 23
i felt as though i were eating in paris .
0 1 2 6 7 9 10 16 17 18 19 23 24 30 31 33 34 39 39 40
the service was excellent - friendly and attentive .
0 3 4 11 12 15 16 25 26 27 28 36 37 40 41 50 50 51
the prices are wonderfully low .
0 3 4 10 11 14 15 26 27 30 30 31
very good wine choices .
0 4 5 9 10 14 15 22 22 23
i ca n't believe people complain about no cheese sticks ?

0 3 4 7 8 17 18 19 20 23 24 25 26 29 30 31 32 38 39 44 45 50 50 51

0 1 2 4 5 10 11 12 13 18 18 19
fantastic !
0 9 9 10
the food is good , i ca n't lie .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 16 16 17 18 19 20 22 22 25 26 29 29 30
but the staff was so horrible to us .
0 3 4 7 8 13 14 17 18 20 21 29 30 32 33 35 35 36
the hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out .
0 3 4 11 12 15 16 19 20 28 29 33 34 44 45 49 50 53 54 57 58 68 69 73 74 79 80 82 83 87 88 90 91 94 94 95
we were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order .
0 2 3 7 8 16 17 19 20 23 24 31 32 35 36 39 40 48 49 58 59 66 67 70 71 75 76 78 79 81 82 88 89 91 92 95 96 97 98 104 105 107 108 113 113 114
this place is pricey , and yes , the food is worth it ; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price .
0 4 5 10 11 13 14 20 20 21 22 25 26 29 29 30 31 34 35 39 40 42 43 48 49 51 51 52 53 56 57 60 61 68 69 74 75 78 79 83 84 88 89 92 93 99 100 102 103 109 110 111 112 118 119 121 122 125 126 131 131 132
save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one !
0 4 5 13 14 17 18 22 23 26 27 34 35 38 39 43 44 48 49 52 52 53

0 1 1 4 5 9 10 14 15 20 20 21
amma is nothing special .
0 4 5 7 8 15 16 23 23 24
the two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place .
0 3 4 7 8 12 13 18 19 23 24 29 30 34 35 39 40 43 44 46 47 51 52 57 58 61 62 67 67 68
i ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive .
0 1 2 5 6 10 11 12 13 17 18 21 22 25 26 31 32 36 37 43 44 51 52 54 55 59 60 63 64 67 68 77 77 78
will not be back .
0 4 5 8 9 11 12 16 16 17
do n't dine at tamarind for the vegetarian dishes , they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections .
0 2 2 5 6 10 11 13 14 22 23 26 27 30 31 41 42 48 48 49 50 54 55 58 59 65 66 69 70 72 73 75 76 79 80 84 85 88 89 96 97 107 107 108
decor is nice though service can be spotty .
0 5 6 8 9 13 14 20 21 28 29 32 33 35 36 42 42 43
this place is always packed .
0 4 5 10 11 13 14 20 21 27 27 28
i know because i live nearby .
0 1 2 6 7 14 15 16 17 21 22 28 28 29
most importantly , food is excellent .
0 4 5 16 16 17 18 22 23 25 26 35 35 36
try the sea bass .
0 3 4 7 8 11 12 16 16 17
highly recommended .
0 6 7 18 18 19
first of all dal bukhara rocks .
0 5 6 8 9 12 13 16 17 24 25 30 30 31
as a student in nyu i need a place to eat after a hard day of work so usually i just go to any indian restraunt near by .
0 2 3 4 5 12 13 15 16 19 20 21 22 26 27 28 29 34 35 37 38 41 42 47 48 49 50 54 55 58 59 61 62 66 67 69 70 77 78 79 80 84 85 87 88 90 91 94 95 101 102 111 112 116 117 119 119 120
but ive heard a lot about this for the past 2 yrs and finally decided to eat here .
0 3 4 7 8 13 14 15 16 19 20 25 26 30 31 34 35 38 39 43 44 45 46 49 50 53 54 61 62 69 70 72 73 76 77 81 81 82
i am happy i did the food was awsome .
0 1 2 4 5 10 11 12 13 16 17 20 21 25 26 29 30 36 36 37
just awsome .
0 4 5 11 11 12
and yes dal bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs .
0 3 4 7 8 11 12 19 20 22 23 25 26 29 30 34 35 38 39 41 42 45 46 49 50 53 54 60 60 61
they are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey .
0 4 5 8 9 16 17 20 21 25 26 32 33 35 36 37 38 41 42 43 44 49 50 55 56 59 60 62 63 70 71 76 77 79 80 81 82 91 92 95 96 103 104 108 109 112 113 120 121 124 125 127 128 138 139 142 143 149 149 150
but overall i give it a 10
0 3 4 11 12 13 14 18 19 21 22 23 24 26
10
0 2
i have n't been to the other locations .
0 1 2 6 6 9 10 14 15 17 18 21 22 27 28 37 37 38
haru on park s is simply disgusting .
0 4 5 7 8 12 13 14 15 17 18 24 25 35 35 36
the fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 16 17 22 23 26 27 30 31 35 36 42 43 46 47 50 51 56 56 57
quite frankly , this is some of the worst sushi i have ever tried .
0 5 6 13 13 14 15 19 20 22 23 27 28 30 31 34 35 40 41 46 47 48 49 53 54 58 59 64 64 65
will never be back .
0 4 5 10 11 13 14 18 18 19
honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives .
0 8 9 12 13 18 19 24 25 27 28 35 36 39 40 41 42 45 46 48 49 52 53 59 60 65 65 66
believe us , we 've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs .
0 7 8 10 10 11 12 14 14 17 18 22 23 29 30 35 36 39 40 44 45 47 48 51 51 52
not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 17 18 28 29 34 35 37 38 43 44 48 49 55 55 56
the all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality .
0 3 4 17 18 23 24 26 27 37 38 40 41 45 46 50 51 58 58 59
limited menu , no-so-fresh ingredients , thinly-sliced fish , fall-apart rice .
0 7 8 12 12 13 14 25 26 37 37 38 39 52 53 57 57 58 59 69 70 74 74 75
the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce -lrb- even its low sodium -rrb- , the vinegar-soaked rice , and the scallion on top of the fish .
0 3 4 8 9 15 16 17 18 23 24 30 31 36 37 40 41 44 45 49 50 55 56 59 60 65 66 67 67 71 72 75 76 79 80 86 86 87 87 88 89 92 93 107 108 112 112 113 114 117 118 121 122 130 131 133 134 137 138 140 141 144 145 149 149 150
the waitstaffs are nice though .
0 3 4 14 15 18 19 23 24 30 30 31
wont come back again for sure !
0 4 5 9 10 14 15 20 21 24 25 29 29 30
i have been to roth 's twice and both times were very disappointing .
0 1 2 6 7 11 12 14 15 19 19 21 22 27 28 31 32 36 37 42 43 47 48 52 53 66 66 67
once for dinner and once for brunch .
0 4 5 8 9 15 16 19 20 24 25 28 29 35 35 36
both times i was extremely dissappointed by the service , which was boarderline rude .
0 4 5 10 11 12 13 16 17 26 27 40 41 43 44 47 48 55 55 56 57 62 63 66 67 78 79 83 83 84
they wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another .
0 4 5 12 13 17 18 21 22 24 25 31 32 34 35 40 41 43 44 48 49 55 56 64 65 72 72 73
much of the time it seems like they do not care about you .
0 4 5 7 8 11 12 16 17 19 20 25 26 30 31 35 36 38 39 42 43 47 48 53 54 57 57 58
the dinner was ok , nothing i would have again .
0 3 4 10 11 14 15 17 17 18 19 26 27 28 29 34 35 39 40 45 45 46
i had their eggs benedict for brunch , which were the worst in my entire life , i tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was .
0 1 2 5 6 11 12 16 17 25 26 29 30 36 36 37 38 43 44 48 49 52 53 58 59 61 62 64 65 71 72 76 76 77 78 79 80 85 86 94 95 98 99 110 111 116 117 127 128 132 133 136 137 140 141 147 148 150 151 154 154 155
this was a great surprise .
0 4 5 8 9 10 11 16 17 25 25 26
with the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room .
0 4 5 8 9 16 17 18 19 25 26 30 31 33 34 37 38 39 40 49 50 54 55 57 58 59 60 69 70 74 74 75

just because it 's cheap does not mean the portions are small or the food is nasty , it is great !

it 's popular w/the late crowd .
0 2 2 4 5 12 13 18 19 23 24 29 29 30
they forgot a sandwich , did n't include plastic forks , and did n't include pita with the hummus platter .

also , the sandwiches -lrb- nearing $ 7 -rrb- did n't come with anything like chips or a side .

overall , not worth the money .
0 7 7 8 9 12 13 18 19 22 23 28 28 29
eating in , the atmosphere saves it , but at your desk , it 's a very disappointing experience .

chennai garden is my favorite indian restaurant in the city .
0 7 8 14 15 17 18 20 21 29 30 36 37 47 48 50 51 54 55 59 59 60

this restaurant is vegetarian ; there are no meat dishes whatsoever .

mermaid inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood .
0 7 8 11 12 14 15 17 18 25 26 30 31 41 42 46 47 53 54 58 59 66 66 67
the menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 19 20 23 24 30 31 34 35 37 38 41 42 48 49 52 53 62 62 63
the lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with scallops and shrimp is great .
0 3 4 11 12 20 21 23 24 28 29 32 33 36 37 46 47 51 52 60 61 64 65 71 72 74 75 80 80 81
the service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing .

the only fallback on this restaurant is the prices .
0 3 4 8 9 17 18 20 21 25 26 36 37 39 40 43 44 50 50 51
even though its good seafood , the prices are too high .
0 4 5 11 12 15 16 20 21 28 28 29 30 33 34 40 41 44 45 48 49 53 53 54
the lobster sandwich is $ 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price .
0 3 4 11 12 20 21 23 24 25 25 27 28 31 32 40 41 43 44 47 48 52 53 55 56 59 60 63 64 70 71 77 78 80 81 88 89 93 94 99 99 100
went to village last night for my birthday .
0 4 5 7 8 15 16 20 21 26 27 30 31 33 34 42 42 43
we picked it randomly , without a recommendation from someone who has been there , so we were n't sure what to expect .
0 2 3 9 10 12 13 21 21 22 23 30 31 32 33 47 48 52 53 60 61 64 65 68 69 73 74 79 79 80 81 83 84 86 87 91 91 94 95 99 100 104 105 107 108 114 114 115
we were very pleasantly surprised .

the food was delicious -lrb- i had a halibut special , my husband had steak -rrb- , and the service was top-notch .

when my dessert came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .
0 4 5 7 8 15 16 20 20 21 22 27 28 31 32 33 34 40 41 43 44 46 47 48 49 52 53 60 61 67 68 73 74 77 78 81 82 83 84 87 88 95 96 99 100 106 107 111 112 116 117 121 122 124 125 132 133 135 136 144 145 149 150 153 154 158 158 159 160 163 164 168 169 171 172 176 177 179 180 183 184 185 186 193 194 203 204 206 207 211 212 216 216 217

we ate at this thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods .

we thought that this place is using too much of msg cooking in the foods .
0 2 3 10 11 15 16 20 21 26 27 29 30 35 36 39 40 44 45 47 48 51 52 59 60 62 63 66 67 72 72 73
why ?
0 3 3 4
they do n't concern much of customer 's health , just want to make money .

the large selection of bruschettas , paninis , tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating .
0 3 4 9 10 19 20 22 23 34 34 35 36 43 43 44 45 56 57 61 62 65 66 72 73 77 78 88 88 89

the service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served .
0 3 4 11 12 15 16 24 24 25 26 28 29 32 33 35 36 40 41 44 45 55 56 59 60 63 64 71 72 74 75 84 85 91 92 95 96 99 100 104 105 110 111 117 118 120 121 125 126 133 134 136 137 139 140 146 146 147
the waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing .
0 3 4 12 12 13 14 19 20 22 23 25 26 30 31 40 41 43 44 51 52 56 57 61 62 70 71 82 82 83
after dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend , asked him : where are you from ... maybe you dont know how things work in america ... and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on .
0 5 6 12 13 16 17 24 25 32 33 35 36 45 45 46 47 52 53 56 56 57 58 63 64 67 68 71 72 76 76 79 79 84 85 88 89 93 94 98 99 102 103 109 110 114 115 117 118 125 125 128 128 131 132 134 135 138 139 142 143 150 151 155 156 162 163 171 172 179 180 184 185 189 190 193 194 197 198 202 203 208 209 213 214 221 222 224 224 225
we did tip , i guess the model/waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager .
0 2 3 6 7 10 10 11 12 13 14 19 20 23 24 38 39 43 44 50 51 55 56 59 60 70 71 73 74 77 78 85 85 86
the whole set up is truly unprofessional and i wish cafe noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place .
0 3 4 9 10 13 14 16 17 19 20 25 26 40 41 44 45 46 47 51 52 56 57 61 62 67 68 71 72 76 77 81 82 87 87 88 89 96 97 104 105 108 109 116 117 120 121 125 126 128 129 130 131 136 137 142 142 143

you should pass on the calamari .

0 1 2 6 7 11 12 15 16 20 21 23 24 27 28 31 32 36 37 47 48 55 56 57 58 64 65 68 69 80 81 83 84 86 87 89 90 97 97 98

i was n't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes , but i guess that 's the price you pay for a popular place .

i was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever .

a gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order .

when asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants , he replied this is not mcdonald 's , every place makes things differently
0 4 5 10 11 16 17 20 21 22 23 30 31 35 36 39 40 48 49 51 52 62 63 65 66 67 68 75 76 78 79 84 85 89 90 101 101 102 103 105 106 113 114 118 119 121 122 125 126 134 134 136 136 137 138 143 144 149 150 155 156 162 163 174
while it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude .
0 5 6 8 9 11 12 26 27 31 32 37 38 43 44 46 47 53 54 63 63 64 65 70 71 74 75 78 79 80 81 85 86 88 89 91 92 103 104 106 107 116 117 120 121 130 131 135 135 136
the service was poor , restaurant poorly lit , staff not very attentive and i would have rather eaten at a mcdonald 's than this joint .
0 3 4 11 12 15 16 20 20 21 22 32 33 39 40 43 43 44 45 50 51 54 55 59 60 69 70 73 74 75 76 81 82 86 87 93 94 99 100 102 103 104 105 113 113 115 116 120 121 125 126 131 131 132

a friend from seattle and i went on a thursday night around 8:30 .
0 1 2 8 9 13 14 21 22 25 26 27 28 32 33 35 36 37 38 46 47 52 53 59 60 64 64 65

i would highly recommend this place !
0 1 2 7 8 14 15 24 25 29 30 35 35 36
i have been to casimir over 5 times and i have always had a great time there .
0 1 2 6 7 11 12 14 15 22 23 27 28 29 30 35 36 39 40 41 42 46 47 53 54 57 58 59 60 65 66 70 71 76 76 77
the food is great and reasonably priced .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 17 18 21 22 32 33 39 39 40
i have tried to make reservations , but both times , the hostess did n't have my name .
0 1 2 6 7 12 13 15 16 20 21 33 33 34 35 38 39 43 44 49 49 50 51 54 55 62 63 66 66 69 70 74 75 77 78 82 82 83
if the weather is nice , try to snag an outside table .
0 2 3 6 7 14 15 17 18 22 22 23 24 27 28 30 31 35 36 38 39 46 47 52 52 53
the staff has been nice , but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often .
0 3 4 9 10 13 14 18 19 23 23 24 25 28 29 33 34 40 41 47 48 56 57 60 61 64 65 71 72 80 81 86 87 89 90 92 93 100 101 105 106 111 111 112
my boyfriend and i went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all i can say is that it was magnificent .
0 2 3 12 13 16 17 18 19 23 24 29 30 32 33 42 43 45 46 54 55 58 59 64 65 70 71 74 75 78 79 80 81 84 85 88 89 91 92 96 97 99 100 103 104 115 115 116
from the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff , i felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it .
0 4 5 8 9 20 21 27 28 30 31 34 35 45 46 55 55 56 57 58 59 63 64 68 69 76 77 80 81 88 89 94 95 101 102 104 105 107 107 108
considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time , the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed .
0 11 12 14 15 19 20 23 24 28 29 36 37 42 43 46 47 49 50 53 54 59 60 63 64 71 72 76 76 77 78 81 82 91 92 95 96 99 100 104 105 107 108 110 111 114 115 118 119 123 124 126 127 131 132 143 144 147 148 155 155 156
i highly recommend caviar russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service .
0 1 2 8 9 18 19 25 26 31 32 34 35 41 42 45 46 51 52 61 62 65 66 71 72 78 79 82 83 92 93 100 100 101

0 1 2 5 6 16 17 26 27 29 30 34 35 39 40 43 44 46 47 54 54 55
friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you 're with .
0 8 9 14 15 19 20 28 29 33 34 37 38 43 44 48 49 53 54 57 58 61 62 69 70 73 73 76 77 81 81 82
my friends and i were on vacation in ny and was referred to chance by a friend .
0 2 3 10 11 14 15 16 17 21 22 24 25 33 34 36 37 39 40 43 44 47 48 56 57 59 60 66 67 69 70 71 72 78 78 79
i found the food to be outstanding , particulary the salmon dish i had .
0 1 2 7 8 11 12 16 17 19 20 22 23 34 34 35 36 47 48 51 52 58 59 63 64 65 66 69 69 70
i also ordered the change mojito , which was out of this world .
0 1 2 6 7 14 15 18 19 25 26 32 32 33 34 39 40 43 44 47 48 50 51 55 56 61 61 62
my friends settled for rice dishes , but we came back the following day to try the dim sum , which was good ... not outstanding , but good .
0 2 3 10 11 18 19 22 23 27 28 34 34 35 36 39 40 42 43 47 48 52 53 56 57 66 67 70 71 73 74 77 78 81 82 85 86 89 89 90 91 96 97 100 101 105 105 108 108 111 112 123 123 124 125 128 129 133 133 134
we ate out in the back patio , which is worth it as it 's cool and the music is hear well there .
0 2 3 6 7 10 11 13 14 17 18 22 23 28 28 29 30 35 36 38 39 44 45 47 48 50 51 53 53 55 56 60 61 64 65 68 69 74 75 77 78 82 83 87 88 93 93 94

i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family .
0 1 2 6 7 9 10 15 16 21 22 23 24 26 27 30 31 35 36 38 39 45 45 46
the food was good .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 17 17 18
the place was nice and calm .
0 3 4 9 10 13 14 18 19 22 23 27 27 28
but the service was a bit slow .
0 3 4 7 8 15 16 19 20 21 22 25 26 30 30 31
i work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time .
0 1 2 6 7 13 14 17 18 24 25 28 29 34 35 37 38 42 43 44 45 54 55 58 59 62 63 68 69 73 73 74
the buffet had a nice selection .
0 3 4 10 11 14 15 16 17 21 22 31 31 32
the food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 20 21 23 24 29 30 39 40 44 45 55 56 61 62 68 68 69
service was also very good .
0 7 8 11 12 16 17 21 22 26 26 27
i would go back .
0 1 2 7 8 10 11 15 15 16
i got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries .
0 1 2 5 6 8 9 18 19 24 25 27 28 38 39 42 43 45 46 49 50 57 58 63 64 68 69 77 77 78
i would recommend roxy 's for that , but not for their food .
0 1 2 7 8 17 18 22 22 24 25 28 29 33 33 34 35 38 39 42 43 46 47 52 53 57 57 58
my son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge !
0 2 3 6 7 10 11 14 15 25 26 30 31 37 38 51 52 55 56 60 61 65 66 70 70 71
but , they were too big for the bun .
0 3 3 4 5 9 10 14 15 18 19 22 23 26 27 30 31 34 34 35
consequently , their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did ` nt feel like finishing them .
0 12 12 13 14 19 20 27 28 32 33 38 39 41 42 47 48 53 54 57 58 62 63 67 68 69 70 74 75 79 80 84 85 88 88 89 89 91 92 96 97 101 102 111 112 116 116 117
also they were $ 15 each !
0 4 5 9 10 14 15 16 16 18 19 23 23 24
i had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll .
0 1 2 5 6 7 8 12 13 21 22 30 31 33 34 35 36 40 40 41
it was $ 14 not really bad for a pound of pastrami-but it did n't have much taste-i 've had better for less elsewhere !
0 2 3 6 7 8 8 10 11 14 15 21 22 25 26 29 30 31 32 37 38 40 41 53 54 56 57 60 60 63 64 68 69 73 74 81 81 84 85 88 89 95 96 99 100 104 105 114 114 115
this place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant , the food .
0 4 5 10 11 13 14 20 21 27 28 31 32 36 37 41 42 51 52 57 58 61 62 66 67 76 77 81 82 84 85 86 88 98 98 99 100 103 104 108 108 109
the last two times i ordered from here my food was soo spicy that i could barely eat it , and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 18 19 20 21 28 29 33 34 38 39 41 42 46 47 50 51 54 55 60 61 65 67 68 69 74 75 81 82 85 86 88 88 89 90 93 94 97 98 103 104 108 109 113 114 118 119 122 123 129 130 132 133 136 137 141 141 142
and the tom kha soup was pathetic .
0 3 4 7 8 11 12 15 16 20 21 24 25 33 33 34
if you want good authentic thai this place is not the place to go .
0 2 3 6 7 11 12 16 17 26 27 31 32 36 37 42 43 45 46 49 50 53 54 59 60 62 63 65 65 66

the pesto pizza was excellent , thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy italian cheese that i 'd never heard of before .
0 3 4 9 10 15 16 19 20 29 29 30 31 41 42 47 48 52 53 54 55 59 60 66 67 69 70 75 76 83 84 90 91 95 96 97 97 99 100 105 106 111 112 114 115 121 121 122

0 12 13 20 21 24 24 25 26 31 32 37 38 40 41 48 49 53
the back garden sitting area is very pleasant , where you can see their personal herb garden .
0 3 4 8 9 15 16 23 24 28 29 31 32 36 37 45 45 46 47 52 53 56 57 60 61 64 65 70 71 79 80 84 85 91 91 92

0 2 3 6 7 10 11 18 19 27 28 31 32 34 35 38 39 48 48 49
my husband said he could 've eaten several more , the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had .
0 2 3 10 11 15 16 18 19 24 24 27 28 33 34 41 42 46 46 47 48 51 52 59 60 63 64 68 69 72 73 75 76 78 79 83 84 93 94 98 99 102 103 109 110 115 116 120 121 124 125 129 130 132 133 136 137 140 140 141
we had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful .

anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet , where greasy , dry and tasteless are complimentary .

the dosas are skimpy , unattractive and drip with grease , and personally i 'd drink popcorn topping before i 'd eat another one of these .

calling the place hampton chutney co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance , but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too .

it is nearly impossible to get a table , so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner , do not pass it up .

it is set far from the small street it 's on , and there is no traffic noise .

the big complaint : no toasting available .
0 3 4 7 8 17 17 18 19 21 22 30 31 40 40 41
i complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted .

so close , but not good enough .

do n't be fooled by crowds of people .
0 2 2 5 6 8 9 15 16 18 19 25 26 28 29 35 35 36
the service is awful .
0 3 4 11 12 14 15 20 20 21
this place is not worth the prices .
0 4 5 10 11 13 14 17 18 23 24 27 28 34 34 35
also , do n't plan on asking for your favorite roll , if it 's not on the menu , you ca n't have it .

furthermore , the rice had no seasoning , so the sushi was bland and disgusting .
0 11 11 12 13 16 17 21 22 25 26 28 29 38 38 39 40 42 43 46 47 52 53 56 57 62 63 66 67 77 77 78
the fish was adequate , but inexpertly sliced .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 21 21 22 23 26 27 37 38 44 44 45
it is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with japanese cuisine .

the food is yummy , especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries .

but the best part about ls is the late night atmosphere , delightfully free of the bts .
0 3 4 7 8 12 13 17 18 23 24 26 27 29 30 33 34 38 39 44 45 55 55 56 57 69 70 74 75 77 78 81 82 85 85 86
you can get a completely delish martini in a glass -lrb- that 's about 2 1/2 drinks -rrb- for $ 8.50 -lrb- i recommend the vanilla shanty , mmmm ! -rrb- in a great homey setting with great music .

the in-house lady dj on saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music , and moreover , takes requests .
0 3 4 12 13 17 18 20 21 23 24 32 33 39 40 43 44 56 57 61 62 67 68 70 71 76 76 77 78 81 82 90 90 91 92 97 98 106 106 107
you ca n't go wrong with this place .
0 3 4 6 6 9 10 12 13 18 19 23 24 28 29 34 34 35
suan is a great place that i often take my friends -lrb- classmates -rrb- too .

its location is good and the fact that hutner college is near and their prices are very reasonable , makes students go back to suan again and again .
0 3 4 12 13 15 16 20 21 24 25 28 29 33 34 38 39 45 46 53 54 56 57 61 62 65 66 71 72 78 79 82 83 87 88 98 98 99 100 105 106 114 115 117 118 122 123 125 126 130 131 136 137 140 141 146 146 147
i love their thai
0 1 2 6 7 12 13 17
noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the must !

i was in love with pongsri on 48th , but compared to suan it is slow in service and overpriced .
0 1 2 5 6 8 9 13 14 18 19 26 27 29 30 34 34 35 36 39 40 48 49 51 52 56 57 59 60 62 63 67 68 70 71 78 79 82 83 93 93 94

0 1 2 6 7 9 10 14 15 17 18 22 23 27 27 28
in summer-eat outside on a terrace -lrb- another great feature of suan -rrb- !!!

i can not imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant .

i can not imagine better indian food in all of the city .

this restaurant used to be our regular thursday night dinner location .
0 4 5 15 16 20 21 23 24 26 27 30 31 38 39 47 48 53 54 60 61 69 69 70
during the course of the past 3 months , the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better .
0 6 7 10 11 17 18 20 21 24 25 29 30 31 32 38 38 39 40 43 44 48 49 52 53 58 59 66 67 70 71 73 74 77 78 81 82 85 86 89 90 96 96 97
i wish they would change back to what it was before .
0 1 2 6 7 11 12 17 18 24 25 29 30 32 33 37 38 40 41 44 45 51 51 52
the food now is inconsistent .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 15 16 28 28 29
this is the kind of place you 'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret .
0 4 5 7 8 11 12 16 17 19 20 25 26 29 29 31 32 36 37 39 40 44 45 48 49 53 54 61 62 64 65 68 69 74 75 79 80 81 82 88 88 89
the setting is casual and romantic .
0 3 4 11 12 14 15 21 22 25 26 34 34 35
prices are very good .
0 6 7 10 11 15 16 20 20 21
the food is excellent !
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 21 21 22
if you 're daring , try the balsamic vinegar over icecream , it 's wonderful !
0 2 3 6 6 9 10 16 16 17 18 21 22 25 26 34 35 42 43 47 48 56 56 57 58 60 60 62 63 72 72 73
do not get the go go hamburgers , no matter what the reviews say .
0 2 3 6 7 10 11 14 15 17 18 20 21 31 31 32 33 35 36 42 43 47 48 51 52 59 60 63 63 64
they were such a rip-off -lrb- $ 8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns -rrb- and not worth trying .
0 4 5 9 10 14 15 16 17 24 25 26 26 27 27 31 32 35 36 40 41 46 47 51 52 59 60 62 63 70 71 75 75 76 77 80 81 84 85 90 91 97 97 98
the rest of the dim sum , though pricey by chinatown standards , is worth it .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 15 16 19 20 23 23 24 25 31 32 38 39 41 42 51 52 61 61 62 63 65 66 71 72 74 74 75
steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table .
0 7 8 13 14 16 17 24 25 28 29 32 33 36 37 39 40 44 45 50 50 51
the wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek -lrb- for chinatown -rrb- alternative .
0 3 4 8 9 13 14 16 17 21 22 25 26 29 30 33 33 34 35 38 39 41 42 45 46 48 48 51 52 56 57 64 65 71 72 74 75 77 78 81 82 89 90 97 98 101 102 105 106 116 117 119 120 123 124 128 129 132 132 133 134 138 139 141 142 143 144 149 150 151 151 154 155 164 164 165 166 177 177 178
a few tips : skip the turnip cake , roast pork buns and egg custards .
0 1 2 5 6 10 10 11 12 16 17 20 21 27 28 32 32 33 34 39 40 44 45 49 50 53 54 57 58 66 66 67
these are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner :
0 5 6 9 10 20 21 24 25 28 29 32 33 36 37 43 44 48 49 55 56 59 60 66 66 67
-lrb- 1 -rrb- turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of mott st. just south of bayard
0 1 1 2 2 3 4 10 11 16 17 19 20 23 24 30 31 36 37 39 40 44 45 49 50 52 53 57 58 61 62 66 67 72 73 75 76 82

after passing by this restaurant for sometime i finally decided to go in and have dinner .
0 5 6 13 14 16 17 21 22 32 33 36 37 45 46 47 48 55 56 63 64 66 67 69 70 72 73 76 77 81 82 88 88 89
i was pleasantly suprised .
0 1 2 5 6 16 17 25 25 26
the food was exceptional .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 24 24 25
the menu consisted of standard brassiere food , better then places like balthazar etc. .
0 3 4 8 9 18 19 21 22 30 31 40 41 45 45 46 47 53 54 58 59 65 66 70 71 80 81 84 84 85
i choose to go with one of the special , the braised lamb shank in red wine , which was excellent .
0 1 2 8 9 11 12 14 15 19 20 23 24 26 27 30 31 38 38 39 40 43 44 51 52 56 57 62 63 65 66 69 70 74 74 75 76 81 82 85 86 95 95 96
the service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual .
0 3 4 11 12 15 16 24 25 28 29 32 33 43 44 47 48 54 54 55
the restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
0 3 4 14 15 17 18 19 20 23 24 29 30 33 34 38 39 41 42 51 52 56 57 60 61 63 64 74 75 79 80 83 84 87 88 92 93 96 97 102 103 104 105 110 111 115
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices .
0 4 5 11 12 17 18 21 22 23 24 28 29 37 38 43 44 47 48 58 59 63 64 70 70 71
the pad se ew chicken was delicious , however the pad thai was far too oily .
0 3 4 7 8 10 11 13 14 21 22 25 26 35 35 36 37 44 45 48 49 52 53 57 58 61 62 65 66 69 70 74 74 75
i would just ask for no oil next time .
0 1 2 7 8 12 13 16 17 20 21 23 24 27 28 32 33 37 37 38
have eaten at ginger house several times , and it 's always good .

the fried dumplings are great !
0 3 4 9 10 19 20 23 24 29 29 30
finally a reliable chinese restaurant !
0 7 8 9 10 18 19 26 27 37 37 38
this place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service .
0 4 5 10 11 16 17 19 20 22 23 27 28 34 35 41 42 44 45 50 51 54 55 57 58 59 60 65 66 70 71 79 80 91 92 100 101 108 108 109
the only thing you can do here is walk in and eat . . but planning an event , especially a small , intimate one , forget about it .
0 3 4 8 9 14 15 18 19 22 23 25 26 30 31 33 34 38 39 41 42 45 46 49 50 51 51 52 53 56 57 65 66 68 69 74 74 75 76 86 87 88 89 94 94 95 96 104 105 108 108 109 110 116 117 122 123 125 125 126
they are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place , but also become hostile !
0 4 5 8 9 12 13 20 21 23 24 27 28 33 34 37 38 42 43 47 48 51 52 55 56 61 62 65 66 72 73 75 76 78 79 82 83 87 88 91 92 97 98 102 103 108 109 115 116 119 120 124 125 128 129 133 134 140 141 148 149 153 154 159 159 160 161 164 165 169 170 176 177 184 184 185
nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything .
0 6 7 9 10 14 15 25 26 30 31 35 36 40 41 48 49 54 55 63 64 67 68 70 71 74 75 78 78 79 80 83 84 87 88 94 95 100 101 115 116 119 120 128 128 129
terrible , terrible management - deserves to be shut-down .
0 8 8 9 10 18 19 29 30 31 32 40 41 43 44 46 47 56 56 57
never fails to please .
0 5 6 11 12 14 15 21 21 22
delicious bagels , especially when right out of the oven .
0 9 10 16 16 17 18 28 29 33 34 39 40 43 44 46 47 50 51 55 55 56
spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey .
0 7 8 11 12 20 21 24 25 30 31 32 33 39 40 41 42 45 46 52 52 53
service is fast and friendly .
0 7 8 10 11 15 16 19 20 28 28 29
only drawback - they wo n't toast your bagel , and they do n't make eggs for the bagel .
0 4 5 13 14 15 16 20 21 23 23 26 27 32 33 37 38 43 43 44 45 48 49 53 54 56 56 59 60 64 65 69 70 73 74 77 78 83 83 84
but that is highly forgivable .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 18 19 29 29 30
been there , done that , and new york , it 's not that big a deal .
0 4 5 10 10 11 12 16 17 21 21 22 23 26 27 30 31 35 35 36 37 39 39 41 42 45 46 50 51 54 55 56 57 61 61 62
the food is decent at best , and the ambience , well , it 's a matter of opinion , some may consider it to be a sweet thing , i thought it was just annoying .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 18 19 21 22 26 26 27 28 31 32 35 36 44 44 45 46 50 50 51 52 54 54 56 57 58 59 65 66 68 69 76 76 77 78 82 83 86 87 95 96 98 99 101 102 104 105 106 107 112 113 118 118 119 120 121 122 129 130 132 133 136 137 141 142 150 150 151
if celebrities make you sweat , then your in for a ride , but if your like most around these parts then you 'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype .

rao is a good restaurant , but it 's nothing special .

i 've eaten at many different indian restaurants .
0 1 1 4 5 10 11 13 14 18 19 28 29 35 36 47 47 48
but after last night , spice grill is the only place i 'm eating indian cuisine .

you must try the shrimp appetizers .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 16 17 23 24 34 34 35
even my indian friend could n't believe how good and tasty everything was .
0 4 5 7 8 14 15 21 22 27 27 30 31 38 39 42 43 47 48 51 52 57 58 68 69 72 72 73
this place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time .

i love ess-a-bagel , but i live on the west side , so i often go to murray 's for convenience .
0 1 2 6 7 18 18 19 20 23 24 25 26 30 31 33 34 37 38 42 43 47 47 48 49 51 52 53 54 59 60 62 63 65 66 72 72 74 75 78 79 90 90 91
their bagels are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a ` special ' bagel experience .
0 5 6 12 13 16 17 21 21 22 23 26 27 31 32 35 36 37 38 44 45 55 55 56 57 60 61 64 65 71 72 73 74 75 75 82 82 83 84 89 90 100 100 101
better than the bagel shop on the corner , but not worth going out of your way for , in my opinion .
0 6 7 11 12 15 16 21 22 26 27 29 30 33 34 40 40 41 42 45 46 49 50 55 56 61 62 65 66 68 69 73 74 77 78 81 81 82 83 85 86 88 89 96 96 97
also a little more expensive than your average bagel place .
0 4 5 6 7 13 14 18 19 28 29 33 34 38 39 46 47 52 53 58 58 59
great bagels made the old-fashioned way .
0 5 6 12 13 17 18 21 22 35 36 39 39 40
the appetizing is excellent - just as good as zabars barney greengrass at a reasonable price -lrb- if bought by the pound -rrb- .
0 3 4 14 15 17 18 27 28 29 30 34 35 37 38 42 43 45 46 52 53 59 60 70 71 73 74 75 76 86 87 92 93 94 94 96 97 103 104 106 107 110 111 116 116 117 117 118

the place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening .

downtown dinner 2002 - prixe fix : appetizers were ok , waiter gave me poor suggestion . . try the potato stuff kanish best one .
0 8 9 15 16 20 21 22 23 28 29 32 32 33 34 44 45 49 50 52 52 53 54 60 61 65 66 68 69 73 74 84 84 85 85 86 86 89 90 93 94 100 101 106 107 113 114 118 119 122 122 123

dessert is a joke ... dont bother
0 7 8 10 11 12 13 17 17 20 20 24 25 31
volare virgins or weekly regulars , everyone gets treated the same and you ca n't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly .
0 6 7 14 15 17 18 24 25 33 33 34 35 43 44 48 49 56 57 60 61 65 66 69 70 73 74 76 76 79 80 83 84 87 88 92 93 97 98 102 103 107 108 111 112 119 120 122 123 127 128 136 136 137
the restaurant has a family feel , not least with regard to the portions which are enormous ; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine .
0 3 4 14 15 18 19 20 21 27 28 32 32 33 34 37 38 43 44 48 49 55 56 58 59 62 63 71 72 77 78 81 82 90 90 91 92 95 96 100 101 106 107 112 113 117 118 133 134 140 141 146 147 152 153 159 159 160
the anti-pasta was excellent , especially the calamari , as were the filling pasta mains .
0 3 4 14 15 18 19 28 28 29 30 40 41 44 45 53 53 54 55 57 58 62 63 66 67 74 75 80 81 86 86 87
the wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal .
0 3 4 8 9 13 14 16 17 26 27 30 31 34 35 41 42 46 47 49 50 52 53 62 63 73 74 80 81 85 85 86
still , any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house ...

out of the hundreds of italian restaurants in queens , this is among the best .
0 3 4 6 7 10 11 19 20 22 23 30 31 42 43 45 46 52 52 53 54 58 59 61 62 67 68 71 72 76 76 77
the shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful .
0 3 4 10 11 17 18 21 22 31 32 35 36 39 40 49 50 54 55 64 64 65
it is expensive but well worth the money .
0 2 3 5 6 15 16 19 20 24 25 30 31 34 35 40 40 41
if you venture off the island of manhattan and ca n't seem to find a great italian restaurant , drive to corona .
0 2 3 6 7 14 15 18 19 22 23 29 30 32 33 42 43 46 47 49 49 52 53 57 58 60 61 65 66 67 68 73 74 81 82 92 92 93 94 99 100 102 103 109 109 110
the only thing more wonderful than the food -lrb- which is exceptional -rrb- is the service .
0 3 4 8 9 14 15 19 20 29 30 34 35 38 39 43 44 45 45 50 51 53 54 65 65 66 67 69 70 73 74 81 81 82
the only thing the waiters do n't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave .

cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most .
0 4 5 13 14 25 26 30 31 35 36 42 43 45 46 52 53 55 56 60 60 61

0 7 8 11 12 16 17 23 24 27 28 36 37 43 43 44
food was very good , but not what i would consider out of this world .
0 4 5 8 9 13 14 18 18 19 20 23 24 27 28 32 33 34 35 40 41 49 50 53 54 56 57 61 62 67 67 68
go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience .
0 2 3 7 8 11 12 13 14 22 23 29 30 33 34 37 38 41 42 44 45 48 49 52 53 56 57 63 64 74 74 75
my friend from milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian .

0 3 4 7 8 11 12 16 17 20 20 23 24 26 27 30 31 35 36 44 44 45
the porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless , so was the seafood tagliatelle .
0 3 4 11 12 20 21 26 27 34 35 38 39 48 48 49 50 52 53 56 57 60 61 68 69 80 80 81
a real dissapointment .
0 1 2 6 7 21 21 22
but that was n't the icing on the cake : a tiramisu that resembled nothing i have ever had .
0 3 4 8 9 12 12 15 16 19 20 25 26 28 29 32 33 37 37 38 39 40 41 49 50 54 55 64 65 72 73 74 75 79 80 84 85 88 88 89
they should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies .
0 4 5 11 12 16 17 23 24 26 27 37 38 42 43 52 53 63 64 67 68 69 70 73 74 77 78 82 83 87 88 91 92 96 97 104 104 105
priced at upper intermediate range .

it was pretty inexpensive too .
0 2 3 6 7 13 14 25 26 29 29 30
this place has the best chinese style bbq ribs in the city .
0 4 5 10 11 14 15 18 19 23 24 31 32 37 38 41 42 46 47 49 50 53 54 58 58 59
i also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee -lrb- rice porridge -rrb- .
0 1 2 6 7 16 17 20 21 25 26 32 33 35 36 39 40 49 50 59 60 62 63 69 70 71 71 75 76 84 84 85 85 86

it 's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone .
0 2 2 4 5 15 16 19 20 21 22 27 28 30 31 33 34 36 37 40 41 45 46 48 49 56 57 64 64 65

when you 're sitting in their main dining room -lrb- which has a spectacular , hand-painted high ceiling -rrb- you 'd never know there was a world outside .
0 4 5 8 8 11 12 19 20 22 23 28 29 33 34 40 41 45 46 47 47 52 53 56 57 58 59 70 70 71 72 84 85 89 90 97 97 98 99 102 102 104 105 110 111 115 116 121 122 125 126 127 128 133 134 141 141 142

this little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money .

the service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals .
0 3 4 11 12 15 16 20 21 24 25 33 34 37 38 41 42 46 47 50 51 55 56 61 62 65 66 70 71 74 75 78 79 83 84 87 88 93 94 96 97 100 101 103 104 108 109 114 114 115
i have to say that i am pleasantly suprised and i will most likely stop in again if i am in the neighborhood .

i have never had cheescake like this .
0 1 2 6 7 12 13 16 17 26 27 31 32 36 36 37
i thought i had died and gone to heaven .
0 1 2 9 10 11 12 15 16 20 21 24 25 29 30 32 33 39 39 40
great spot , whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner .

warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months .
0 4 5 8 9 17 18 20 21 24 25 31 32 35 36 44 45 52 53 60 61 63 64 67 68 74 75 81 81 82
the food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices .

have been several times and it never dissapoints .
0 4 5 9 10 17 18 23 24 27 28 30 31 36 37 48 48 49
after hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant , and passing by it on a daily basis , we decided to try .
0 5 6 13 14 15 16 19 20 22 23 28 29 35 36 41 42 45 46 56 56 57 58 61 62 69 70 72 73 75 76 78 79 80 81 86 87 92 92 93 94 96 97 104 105 107 108 111 111 112
we were less than impressed .
0 2 3 7 8 12 13 17 18 27 27 28
while the ambiance and atmosphere were great , the food and service could have been a lot better .
0 5 6 9 10 18 19 22 23 33 34 38 39 44 44 45 46 49 50 54 55 58 59 66 67 72 73 77 78 82 83 84 85 88 89 95 95 96
we ordered the chicken casserole , but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken , all dark meat and on the bone .
0 2 3 10 11 14 15 22 23 32 32 33 34 37 38 42 43 45 46 49 50 54 55 56 57 60 61 66 67 73 74 76 77 84 84 85 86 89 90 94 95 99 100 103 104 106 107 110 111 115 115 116
probably would not go again ...
0 8 9 14 15 18 19 21 22 27 27 30
i 've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine , if not good .
0 1 1 4 5 9 10 12 13 21 22 27 28 31 32 36 37 42 43 46 47 51 52 55 56 60 60 61 62 64 65 68 69 73 73 74
stick with the chicken , beef , and lamb dishes .
0 5 6 10 11 14 15 22 22 23 24 28 28 29 30 33 34 38 39 45 45 46
i do n't usually order wine with indian so i ca n't comment on their wine list or their wines .
0 1 2 4 4 7 8 15 16 21 22 26 27 31 32 38 39 41 42 43 44 46 46 49 50 57 58 60 61 66 67 71 72 76 77 79 80 85 86 91 91 92
instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian .
0 7 8 15 16 18 19 22 23 27 28 32 33 38 39 41 42 44 45 50 51 55 56 62 62 63
service is friendly , and never had a problem walking in and getting a table .
0 7 8 10 11 19 19 20 21 24 25 30 31 34 35 36 37 44 45 52 53 55 56 59 60 67 68 69 70 75 75 76
i would recommend reservations on weekends though .
0 1 2 7 8 17 18 30 31 33 34 42 43 49 49 50

as a fan of thai , i have tried quite a few different restaurants in nyc and this one was definitely the worst .
0 2 3 4 5 8 9 11 12 16 16 17 18 19 20 24 25 30 31 36 37 38 39 42 43 52 53 64 65 67 68 71 72 75 76 80 81 84 85 88 89 99 100 103 104 109 109 110
the food was not fresh , the sauces were bland and very oily .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 16 17 22 22 23 24 27 28 34 35 39 40 45 46 49 50 54 55 59 59 60
it just was n't thai .
0 2 3 7 8 11 11 14 15 19 19 20
went to ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza -lrb- as i love la pizza fresca -rrb- .
0 4 5 7 8 14 15 18 19 22 23 32 33 44 45 50 51 52 52 54 55 56 57 61 62 64 65 70 71 77 77 78 78 79
was surprisingly disappointed .
0 3 4 16 17 29 29 30
pizza was a little soggy .
0 5 6 9 10 11 12 18 19 24 24 25
ravioli was good ... but i have to say that i found everything a bit overpriced .
0 7 8 11 12 16 16 19 19 22 23 24 25 29 30 32 33 36 37 41 42 43 44 49 50 60 61 62 63 66 67 77 77 78
not enough wines by the glass either .
0 3 4 10 11 16 17 19 20 23 24 29 30 36 36 37
service , however , was excellent ... and i liked the setting/atmosphere a lot .
0 7 7 8 9 16 16 17 18 21 22 31 31 34 34 37 38 39 40 45 46 49 50 68 69 70 71 74 74 75
food was just average ... if they lowered the prices just a bit , it would be a bigger draw .
0 4 5 8 9 13 14 21 21 24 24 26 27 31 32 39 40 43 44 50 51 55 56 57 58 61 61 62 63 65 66 71 72 74 75 76 77 83 84 88 88 89

0 3 4 10 11 14 15 25 26 28 29 33 34 36 37 41 41 42
bottles of wine are cheap and good .
0 7 8 10 11 15 16 19 20 25 26 29 30 34 34 35
what more could you want ?
0 4 5 9 10 15 16 19 20 24 24 25
the food was actually aweful .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 21 22 28 28 29
i 'm not picky - but it was actually gross .
0 1 1 3 4 7 8 13 14 15 16 19 20 22 23 26 27 35 36 41 41 42
the mussles were the fishiest things i 've ever tasted , the seabass was bland , the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese , the penne w / chicken had bones in it ... it was disgusting .
0 3 4 11 12 16 17 20 21 29 30 36 37 38 38 41 42 46 47 53 53 54 55 58 59 66 67 70 71 76 76 77 78 81 82 86 87 93 94 99 100 103 104 111 112 115 116 120 121 127 127 128 129 132 133 138 139 140 140 141 142 149 150 153 154 159 160 162 163 165 165 168 169 171 172 175 176 186 186 187

0 4 5 7 8 10 11 18 19 24 25 27 28 31 32 36 37 41 42 47 47 48
i really recommend the very simple unda -lrb- egg -rrb- rolls .

in an area sadly lacking in decent thai food , this is one of the best spots .
0 2 3 5 6 10 11 16 17 24 25 27 28 34 35 39 40 44 44 45 46 50 51 53 54 57 58 60 61 64 65 69 70 75 75 76
went here last night - nice decor , good service , but the food was surprisingly excellent .
0 4 5 9 10 14 15 20 21 22 23 27 28 33 33 34 35 39 40 47 47 48 49 52 53 56 57 61 62 65 66 78 79 88 88 89
the portions are huge , so it might be good to order three things to split -lrb- rather than one appetizer and entree per person -rrb- for two people .
0 3 4 12 13 16 17 21 21 22 23 25 26 28 29 34 35 37 38 42 43 45 46 51 52 57 58 64 65 67 68 73 74 75 75 81 82 86 87 90 91 100 101 104 105 111 112 115 116 122 122 123 124 127 128 131 132 138 138 139
among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants , this offers by far one of the best values for your money .
0 5 6 9 10 12 13 16 17 20 21 24 25 31 32 43 43 44 45 49 50 56 57 59 60 63 64 67 68 70 71 74 75 79 80 86 87 90 91 95 96 101 101 102

for those that go once and do n't enjoy it , all i can say is that they just do n't get it .

fabulous decor - makes you feel like you 're in a trendy manhattan restaurant , very very good food , cheaply-priced , generally friendly staff , and if you 're a manhattanite , or spend most of your time in manhattan , rice avenue will make you feel at home ... very soho/village/upper west side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele ... all on roosevelt avenue !

0 1 2 6 7 9 10 14 15 17 18 19 20 26 27 36 37 41 42 46 47 49 50 52 53 64 64 65 66 69 70 75 76 81 82 91 92 97 98 103 103 104
the restaurant was packed at first , so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated .
0 3 4 14 15 18 19 25 26 28 29 34 34 35 36 38 39 41 42 48 49 51 52 55 56 59 60 63 64 69 70 72 73 80 81 87 88 90 91 95 96 102 102 103
most of the servers are very attentive , friendly and quite attractive .
0 4 5 7 8 11 12 19 20 23 24 28 29 38 38 39 40 48 49 52 53 58 59 69 69 70
the atmosphere was mostly of an older crowd , but there were a few groups of mid 20 's / 30 year olds also .
0 3 4 14 15 18 19 25 26 28 29 31 32 37 38 43 43 44 45 48 49 54 55 59 60 61 62 65 66 72 73 75 76 79 80 82 82 84 84 85 85 87 88 92 93 97 98 102 102 103
the vibe is very relaxed and cozy , service was great and the food was excellent !
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 16 17 24 25 28 29 33 33 34 35 42 43 46 47 52 53 56 57 60 61 65 66 69 70 79 79 80
me and my girls will definitely go back .

food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when i went .
0 4 5 8 9 13 14 17 18 21 22 26 27 29 30 33 34 37 38 42 43 47 48 55 56 59 60 68 69 73 74 76 77 78 79 84 85 90 91 94 95 99 100 104 105 107 108 112 113 114 115 119 119 120
i would highly recommand requesting a table by the window .
0 1 2 7 8 14 15 24 25 35 36 37 38 43 44 46 47 50 51 57 57 58
although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat .
0 8 9 13 14 16 17 20 21 28 29 33 34 38 39 41 42 47 48 53 54 57 58 62 63 72 73 76 77 84 85 88 89 93 94 97 98 105 106 110 111 119 120 122 123 128 129 131 132 135 135 136
i 've eaten at pizza gruppo a few times , but more often i order delivery .
0 1 1 4 5 10 11 13 14 19 20 26 27 28 29 32 33 38 38 39 40 43 44 48 49 54 55 56 57 62 63 71 71 72
the food is great .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 17 17 18
personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights .
0 8 9 13 14 17 18 21 22 29 30 34 35 38 39 44 45 51 52 58 58 59
i heartily recommend .
0 1 2 10 11 20 20 21
there is a downside if you 're ordering in -- the delivery guys have major attitude .
0 5 6 8 9 10 11 19 20 22 23 26 26 29 30 38 39 41 42 44 45 48 49 57 58 62 63 67 68 73 74 82 82 83
never have i had such dramatic delivery guys -lrb- a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c i live in a walkup -rrb- who always seem disappointed with their tips .
0 5 6 10 11 12 13 16 17 21 22 30 31 39 40 44 45 46 46 47 48 51 52 54 55 62 63 66 67 74 75 78 79 88 89 94 95 101 102 105 106 107 108 112 113 115 116 117 118 124 124 125 126 129 130 136 137 141 142 154 155 159 160 165 166 170 170 171
hey , i think $ 2 + for a 5 block walk ai n't bad .
0 3 3 4 5 6 7 12 13 14 14 15 15 16 17 20 21 22 23 24 25 30 31 35 36 38 38 41 42 45 45 46
love the scene first off - the place has a character and nice light to it . . very fortunate , location wise .
0 4 5 8 9 14 15 20 21 24 24 25 26 29 30 35 36 39 40 41 42 51 52 55 56 60 61 66 67 69 70 72 72 73 73 74 74 78 79 88 88 89 90 98 99 103 103 104
the pizza was pretty good and huge .
0 3 4 9 10 13 14 20 21 25 26 29 30 34 34 35
the price very reasonable .
0 3 4 9 10 14 15 25 25 26
we were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion ... a bucket of food literally .
0 2 3 7 8 9 10 13 14 17 18 21 22 28 29 33 34 39 40 41 42 44 45 50 51 56 57 60 61 73 74 82 83 90 90 93 93 94 95 101 102 104 105 109 110 119 119 120
we got most of it back at home with us .
0 2 3 6 7 11 12 14 15 17 18 22 23 25 26 30 31 35 36 38 38 39
i would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i ca n't not mention or undermine .
0 1 2 7 8 11 12 16 17 20 21 24 25 29 30 33 34 39 40 43 44 47 48 57 58 60 61 63 64 71 72 80 81 85 86 87 88 90 90 93 94 97 98 105 106 108 109 118 118 119
the pasta penne was pretty extra buttery , creamy which means a big task to diggest . . tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count , penne ... got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed ... lol

0 1 2 6 7 9 10 18 19 21 22 26 27 31 32 34 35 39 39 40
i found it on a cold night , the perfect spot to warm up .
0 1 2 7 8 10 11 13 14 15 16 20 21 26 26 27 28 31 32 39 40 44 45 47 48 52 53 55 55 56

this place blew me away ... by far my new favorite restaurant on the uppereast side .
0 4 5 10 11 15 16 18 19 23 23 26 26 28 29 32 33 35 36 39 40 48 49 59 60 62 63 66 67 76 77 81 81 82

0 4 5 8 9 19 20 21 22 26 27 31 32 33 34 37 38 40 41 46 46 47

i just read mocaramel 's review and felt compelled to respond .

i have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at la lanterna .
0 1 2 6 7 11 12 18 19 23 24 27 28 33 34 37 38 42 43 50 51 54 55 59 60 66 67 69 70 73 74 79 80 83 84 91 92 95 96 99 100 105 106 111 112 114 115 117 118 126 126 127
over the years the host , vittorio , and his crew , have always treated me as family -- although with all the business this not-so-little gem does , it amazing he 's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor .
0 4 5 8 9 14 15 18 19 23 23 24 25 33 33 34 35 38 39 42 43 47 47 48 49 53 54 60 61 68 69 71 72 74 75 81 81 83 83 91 92 96 97 100 101 104 105 113 114 118 119 132 133 136 137 141 141 142 143 145 146 153 154 156 156 158 159 163 164 168 169 171 172 180 181 182 183 193 194 197 198 213 214 221 221 222
i 've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years : a new jazz bar , the most fantastic dining garden , the best thin crust pizzas , and now a lasagna menu which is to die for -lrb- these are not your average lasagnas -rrb- !
