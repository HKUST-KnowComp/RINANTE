the food here was mediocre at best .
0 3 4 8 9 13 14 17 18 26 27 29 30 34 34 35
it was totally overpriced - fish and chips was about $ 15 ...

0 3 4 11 12 22 23 26 27 28 29 32 33 38 39 42 43 45 45 46
but the best pork souvlaki i ever had is the main thing .

the space kind of feels like an alice in wonderland setting , without it trying to be that .

delivery can be spot on or lacking depending on the weather and the day of the week .
0 8 9 12 13 15 16 20 21 23 24 26 27 34 35 44 45 47 48 51 52 59 60 63 64 67 68 71 72 74 75 78 79 83 83 84

we 've found it to be better and fresher than kiku which is comparable in price .

0 3 4 9 10 12 13 14 15 18 19 25 26 30 30 31 32 35 36 40 41 44 45 48 49 54 54 55 56 58 58 60 61 64 65 70 71 73 73 74

0 5 6 11 12 14 15 20 21 24 25 30 31 35 36 42
there is something about their atmosphere that makes me come back nearly every week .
0 5 6 8 9 18 19 24 25 30 31 41 42 46 47 52 53 55 56 60 61 65 66 72 73 78 79 83 83 84

excellent food for great prices
0 9 10 14 15 18 19 24 25 31
my husband and i have been sold on this from the first visit .
0 2 3 10 11 14 15 16 17 21 22 26 27 31 32 34 35 39 40 44 45 48 49 54 55 60 60 61
the wait staff is very courteous and accomodating .
0 3 4 8 9 14 15 17 18 22 23 32 33 36 37 49 49 50
the space is limited so be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes - 1 hour , but be richly rewarded when you savor the delicious indo-chinese food .
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 20 21 23 24 26 27 35 36 38 39 43 44 46 47 49 50 52 53 60 61 62 63 64 65 69 69 70 71 74 75 77 78 84 85 93 94 98 99 102 103 108 109 112 113 122 123 135 136 140 140 141

its alright
0 3 4 11
im not necessarily fanatical about this place , but it was a fun time for low pirces .
0 2 3 6 7 18 19 28 29 34 35 39 40 45 45 46 47 50 51 53 54 57 58 59 60 63 64 68 69 72 73 76 77 83 83 84
lobster was good , nothing spectacular .
0 7 8 11 12 16 16 17 18 25 26 37 37 38
its just a fun place to go , not a five star restaraunt .
0 3 4 8 9 10 11 14 15 20 21 23 24 26 26 27 28 31 32 33 34 38 39 43 44 54 54 55
way below average
0 3 4 9 10 17
i think the pizza is so overrated and was under cooked .
0 1 2 7 8 11 12 17 18 20 21 23 24 33 34 37 38 41 42 47 48 54 54 55
had no flavor and the staff is rude and not attentive .
0 3 4 6 7 13 14 17 18 21 22 27 28 30 31 35 36 39 40 43 44 53 53 54
would never go back
0 5 6 11 12 14 15 19
i love this place
0 1 2 6 7 11 12 17
i was n't here for the pizza so i ca n't comment on that yet but what i had was very good .
0 1 2 5 5 8 9 13 14 17 18 21 22 27 28 30 31 32 33 35 35 38 39 46 47 49 50 54 55 58 59 62 63 67 68 69 70 73 74 77 78 82 83 87 87 88
the service was quick and friendly .
0 3 4 11 12 15 16 21 22 25 26 34 34 35
everyone was smiling so that made me feel welcome .
0 8 9 12 13 20 21 23 24 28 29 33 34 36 37 41 42 49 49 50
i thought the restaurant was nice and clean .
0 1 2 9 10 13 14 24 25 28 29 33 34 37 38 43 43 44
i ordered the vitello alla marsala and i was pretty impressed .
0 1 2 9 10 13 14 21 22 26 27 34 35 38 39 40 41 44 45 51 52 61 61 62
the veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 16 17 26 27 31 32 38 39 48 48 49
the potato balls were not dry at all ... in fact it was buttery .
0 3 4 10 11 16 17 21 22 25 26 29 30 32 33 36 36 39 40 42 43 47 48 50 51 54 55 62 62 63
the only downside ... they only take cash which is ok if you know about it ahead of time .
0 3 4 8 9 17 17 20 21 25 26 30 31 35 36 40 41 46 47 49 50 52 53 55 56 59 60 64 65 70 71 73 74 79 80 82 83 87 87 88

not because you are `` the four seasons '' ... -- you are allowed to charge an arm and a leg for a romatic dinner .

the food was excellent as well as service , however , i left the four seasons very dissappointed .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 22 23 25 26 30 31 33 34 41 41 42 43 50 50 51 52 53 54 58 59 62 63 67 68 75 76 80 81 94 94 95

the seafood dynamite is also otherworldly .

really , i find it rather scandalous that such a crappy restaurant attracts such crowds -- this , in the city of a million restaurants , at least 9/10 of which are way better than this one .

this small astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in new york .

what really makes it shine is the food , which is aggressively seasoned with cyrpriot spices , and all made in-house -lrb- even the gyro meat and sausages -rrb- , and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected .
0 4 5 11 12 17 18 20 21 26 27 29 30 33 34 38 38 39 40 45 46 48 49 61 62 70 71 75 76 84 85 91 91 92 93 96 97 100 101 105 106 114 115 116 116 120 121 124 125 129 130 134 135 138 139 147 147 148 148 149 150 153 154 158 159 161 162 166 167 173 174 181 182 193 194 198 199 204 205 214 215 217 218 226 226 227
all the various greek and cypriot dishes are excellent , but the gyro is the reason to come -- if you do n't eat one your trip was wasted .

the wine list was extensive - though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings .

the bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the `` free '' appetizer of olives was disappointing .
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 21 22 25 26 34 35 36 37 41 42 46 47 50 51 55 56 57 58 61 62 65 66 67 67 71 71 72 73 82 83 85 86 92 93 96 97 110 110 111
however , our main course was wonderful .
0 7 7 8 9 12 13 17 18 24 25 28 29 38 38 39
i had fish and my husband had the filet - both of which exceeded our expectations .
0 1 2 5 6 10 11 14 15 17 18 25 26 29 30 33 34 39 40 41 42 46 47 49 50 55 56 64 65 68 69 81 81 82
the dessert -lrb- we had a pear torte -rrb- was good - but , once again , the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions .
0 3 4 11 12 13 13 15 16 19 20 21 22 26 27 32 32 33 34 37 38 42 43 44 45 48 48 49 50 54 55 60 60 61 62 65 66 71 72 75 76 82 83 85 86 93 94 105 106 111 112 123 123 124
when we inquired about ports - the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost .
0 4 5 7 8 16 17 22 23 28 29 30 31 34 35 43 44 50 51 54 55 62 63 66 67 70 71 74 75 79 80 85 86 96 97 99 100 104 104 105
not what i would expect for the price and prestige of this location .
0 3 4 8 9 10 11 16 17 23 24 27 28 31 32 37 38 41 42 50 51 53 54 58 59 67 67 68
all in all , i would return - as it was a beautiful restaurant - but i hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future .
0 3 4 6 7 10 10 11 12 13 14 19 20 26 27 28 29 31 32 34 35 38 39 40 41 50 51 61 62 63 64 67 68 69 70 74 75 78 79 84 85 89 90 94 95 104 105 107 108 111 112 118 119 126 127 129 130 133 134 140 140 141
short and sweet -- seating is great : it 's romantic , cozy and private .
0 5 6 9 10 15 16 17 18 25 26 28 29 34 34 35 35 37 37 39 40 48 48 49 49 53 54 57 58 65 65 66
the boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they 're perfect for 2 people .
0 3 4 9 10 13 14 17 18 20 21 26 27 29 30 34 35 37 38 41 42 49 50 54 55 59 60 63 64 66 67 71 72 76 76 79 80 87 88 91 92 93 94 100 100 101
the service was extremely fast and attentive -lrb- thanks to the service button on your table -rrb- but i barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order .
0 3 4 11 12 15 16 25 26 30 31 34 35 44 44 45 45 51 52 54 55 58 59 66 67 73 74 76 77 81 82 87 87 88 89 92 93 94 95 101 102 112 113 114 115 119 120 124 125 128 129 135 136 140 141 144 145 150 150 151
the food was ok and fair nothing to go crazy .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 15 16 19 20 24 25 32 33 35 36 38 39 44 44 45

so what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food .
0 2 3 7 8 11 12 18 19 22 23 25 26 32 33 36 37 39 40 43 44 54 55 58 59 62 63 67 67 68

0 7 8 11 12 15 16 25 25 26 27 31 32 34 35 37 38 46 46 47
sometimes tables do n't understand his sense of humor but it 's refreshing to have a server who has personality , professionalism , and respects the privacy of your dinner .

this is the first place i 've been that a runner remembers my order ... hope he likes his job because i have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant .

i go out to eat and like my courses , servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink .

restaurants in manhattan should try to model food and service after this place .

maggot in the food !
0 6 7 9 10 13 14 18 18 19
i 've been wanting to go to this place forever and finally got a table .
0 1 1 4 5 9 10 17 18 20 21 23 24 26 27 31 32 37 38 45 46 49 50 57 58 61 62 63 64 69 69 70
the menu looked great , and the waiter was very nice , but when the food came , it was average .
0 3 4 8 9 15 16 21 21 22 23 26 27 30 31 37 38 41 42 46 47 51 51 52 53 56 57 61 62 65 66 70 71 75 75 76 77 79 80 83 84 91 91 92
nevertheless , i finished my plate , and that 's when i found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom .
0 12 12 13 14 15 16 24 25 27 28 33 33 34 35 38 39 43 43 45 46 50 51 52 53 58 59 60 61 67 68 70 71 79 80 85 86 88 89 92 93 99 99 100
i showed it to the manager , and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts -lrb- but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for -rrb- .
0 1 2 8 9 11 12 14 15 18 19 26 26 27 28 31 32 34 35 44 45 55 56 59 60 67 68 70 71 74 75 79 80 88 89 90 90 93 94 97 98 101 102 105 106 108 109 113 114 116 117 123 124 127 128 130 131 138 139 142 143 147 148 151 152 160 161 163 164 169 170 174 175 180 181 184 184 185 185 186
when the bill came , nothing was comped , so i told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine , but i did n't think i should have to pay for food with a maggot in it .
0 4 5 8 9 13 14 18 18 19 20 27 28 31 32 38 38 39 40 42 43 44 45 49 50 53 54 61 62 66 67 75 76 80 81 83 84 88 89 96 97 99 100 103 104 107 108 111 112 116 116 117 118 121 122 123 124 127 127 130 131 136 137 138 139 145 146 150 151 153 154 157 158 161 162 166 167 171 172 173 174 180 181 183 184 186 186 187
yes , i ate the food , but i certainly would not have if i had seen the maggot before eating , and i was at this point fairly sick to my stomach .
0 3 3 4 5 6 7 10 11 14 15 19 19 20 21 24 25 26 27 36 37 42 43 46 47 51 52 54 55 56 57 60 61 65 66 69 70 76 77 83 84 90 90 91 92 95 96 97 98 101 102 104 105 109 110 115 116 122 123 127 128 130 131 133 134 141 141 142
the manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine -lrb- which cost less than the food -rrb- , and made it seem like a big concession .
0 3 4 11 12 19 20 24 25 27 28 33 34 38 39 42 43 46 47 54 55 57 58 62 63 64 64 69 70 74 75 79 80 84 85 88 89 93 93 94 94 95 96 99 100 104 105 107 108 112 113 117 118 119 120 123 124 134 134 135
we paid and left because we did n't feel like arguing any more .

i have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food .

for a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .
0 3 4 5 6 16 17 21 22 26 27 28 29 33 34 44 45 48 49 53 54 56 57 64 65 67 68 74 74 75 76 81 82 85 86 88 89 95 96 99 100 104 105 106 107 111 112 114 115 126 127 135 136 143 143 144
a fairly late entry into the haute barnyard sweepstakes , flatbush farm is n't in the same league as the blue hills or even the farm on adderlys of the world , but it 's pretty good , albeit with a somewhat dismal setting .

i 've had my fair share of modern japanese and this spot delivers .
0 1 1 4 5 8 9 11 12 16 17 22 23 25 26 32 33 41 42 45 46 50 51 55 56 64 64 65
the atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking , which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors .
0 3 4 14 15 18 19 25 26 30 31 34 35 38 39 40 41 44 45 52 52 53 54 59 60 62 63 68 69 71 72 76 77 79 80 83 84 88 89 90 91 96 97 103 104 106 107 114 114 115
if you 're into being lost when you 're just five feet from your table then hey , that 's a good thing .
0 2 3 6 6 9 10 14 15 20 21 25 26 30 31 34 34 37 38 42 43 47 48 52 53 57 58 62 63 68 69 73 74 77 77 78 79 83 83 85 86 87 88 92 93 98 98 99
despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my go-to for modern japanese food for the foreseeable future .

another review here claimed the pre-fix was $ 29/per person including sake but it is $ 55 per person not including sake .

indo chinese food , pretty good ...
0 4 5 12 13 17 17 18 19 25 26 30 30 33
not a very fancy place but very good chinese style indian food .
0 3 4 5 6 10 11 16 17 22 23 26 27 31 32 36 37 44 45 50 51 57 58 62 62 63
the chicken lollipop is my favorite , most of the dishes -lrb- i have to agree with a previous reviewer -rrb- are quite oily and very spicy , espeically the chilli chicken .
0 3 4 11 12 20 21 23 24 26 27 35 35 36 37 41 42 44 45 48 49 55 56 57 57 58 59 63 64 66 67 72 73 77 78 79 80 88 89 97 97 98 99 102 103 108 109 113 114 117 118 122 123 128 128 129 130 140 141 144 145 151 152 159 159 160
my mom originally introduced me to this place , but even she -lrb- being indian -rrb- feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily .
0 2 3 6 7 17 18 28 29 31 32 34 35 39 40 45 45 46 47 50 51 55 56 59 60 61 61 66 67 73 73 74 75 80 81 84 85 89 90 93 94 96 97 105 106 110 111 114 115 118 119 124 125 128 129 132 133 136 137 141 141 142
still we keep going back : -rrb-
0 5 6 8 9 13 14 19 20 24 25 26 26 27
i was speechless by the horrible food .
0 1 2 5 6 16 17 19 20 23 24 32 33 37 37 38
i attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant , and the food was majorly disappointing .
0 1 2 10 11 12 13 20 21 27 28 30 31 34 35 45 45 46 47 50 51 54 55 59 60 63 64 71 72 85 85 86
rather than eating the meat entree being offered , i requested a vegetarian dish .
0 6 7 11 12 18 19 22 23 27 28 34 35 40 41 48 48 49 50 51 52 61 62 63 64 74 75 79 79 80
rather than preparing vegetarian dish , the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables -lrb- minus sauce , seasoning , or any form or aesthetic presentation -rrb- .
0 6 7 11 12 21 22 32 33 37 37 38 39 42 43 47 48 57 58 60 61 65 66 67 68 73 74 76 77 84 85 95 96 97 97 102 103 108 108 109 110 119 119 120 121 123 124 127 128 132 133 135 136 145 146 158 158 159 159 160
i was so stunned , and i left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing .
0 1 2 5 6 8 9 16 16 17 18 21 22 23 24 28 29 32 33 39 40 46 47 50 51 58 59 72 72 73
this place survives on reputation alone .
0 4 5 10 11 19 20 22 23 33 34 39 39 40
i will never return .
0 1 2 6 7 12 13 19 19 20

0 4 5 6 7 10 11 15 15 16
great hot dogs . .
0 5 6 9 10 14 14 15 15 16
the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside .
0 3 4 7 8 12 13 17 18 23 24 27 28 34 35 41 42 45 46 49 50 56 57 59 60 66 67 70 71 75 76 78 79 82 83 90 90 91
great toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost !

helpful service and average price per dish $ 10 .
0 7 8 15 16 19 20 27 28 33 34 37 38 42 43 44 44 46 46 47
the only thing that strikes you is the decor ? -lrb- not very pleasant -rrb- .

0 3 4 11 12 15 16 23 24 27 28 31 32 37 38 40 41 51 51 52
be prepared to wait , because the place is pretty tiny .

the martinis are amazing and very fairly priced .
0 3 4 12 13 16 17 24 25 28 29 33 34 40 41 47 47 48

you can get a table without a reservation if you get there early i they do n't make you by bottles .
0 3 4 7 8 11 12 13 14 19 20 27 28 29 30 41 42 44 45 48 49 52 53 58 59 64 65 66 67 71 72 74 74 77 78 82 83 86 87 89 90 97 97 98

one of the best , if not the best , restaurants in park slope -lrb- and ny in general -rrb-

everything on the menu is great .
0 10 11 13 14 17 18 22 23 25 26 31 31 32
this establishment is the real deal .
0 4 5 18 19 21 22 25 26 30 31 35 35 36
wish ny had more of these kind of places : intimate , superb food , homey , top notch all the way around , certainly worth the wait .
0 4 5 7 8 11 12 16 17 19 20 25 26 30 31 33 34 40 40 41 42 50 50 51 52 58 59 63 63 64 65 70 70 71 72 75 76 81 82 85 86 89 90 93 94 100 100 101 102 111 112 117 118 121 122 126 126 127
there is `` expensive-but-worth-it '' and there is `` expensive-and-wtf '' ?

this is a twenty-something guy that does n't mind laying down $ 300 for a fine and delicious meal for 2 on special occassions .
0 4 5 7 8 9 10 26 27 30 31 35 36 40 40 43 44 48 49 55 56 60 61 62 62 65 66 69 70 71 72 76 77 80 81 90 91 95 96 99 100 101 102 104 105 112 113 123 123 124
but $ 500 for a dinner for two that did n't include wine ?
0 3 4 5 5 8 9 12 13 14 15 21 22 25 26 29 30 34 35 38 38 41 42 49 50 54 54 55
are you freaking kidding me ?
0 3 4 7 8 16 17 24 25 27 27 28
look , the appetizers were really good .
0 4 4 5 6 9 10 20 21 25 26 32 33 37 37 38
the entree was also very good .
0 3 4 10 11 14 15 19 20 24 25 29 29 30
ca n't argue about that , but they are clearly over priced .
0 2 2 5 6 11 12 17 18 22 22 23 24 27 28 32 33 36 37 44 45 49 50 56 56 57
what you are paying for is the environment and the name .
0 4 5 8 9 12 13 19 20 23 24 26 27 30 31 42 43 46 47 50 51 55 55 56
yes , the place is classy and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber whealthy not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while .
0 3 3 4 5 8 9 14 15 17 18 24 25 28 29 38 38 39 40 43 44 48 49 53 54 63 64 70 71 74 75 79 80 88 89 92 93 96 97 103 104 107 108 112 113 118 119 121 122 124 125 128 129 132 133 138 139 143 144 146 147 148 149 154 154 155

entrees : vanison steak and bison steak .
0 7 7 8 9 16 17 22 23 26 27 32 33 38 38 39
vanison was good but not amazing .

0 4 5 8 9 13 14 16 17 20 20 21
some pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing not impressive at all .

i read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and i thought to myself , but may be it is worth it .
0 1 2 6 7 14 15 19 20 26 27 30 31 41 42 45 46 55 56 59 60 61 62 69 70 72 73 79 79 80 81 84 85 88 89 91 92 94 95 97 98 103 104 106 106 107
i was wrong .

the four seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of new york city restaurants , but trust me , they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say `` i 've been to the four seasons restaurant '' .

i wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly , curiousity got the best of me and i paid dearly for it .

the environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts .
0 3 4 15 16 18 19 23 24 31 32 35 36 39 40 44 45 48 49 50 51 54 55 57 58 62 63 67 68 72 73 79 80 85 86 88 89 93 94 100 101 105 106 113 113 114
if you are going for the food , it will not be worth it .
0 2 3 6 7 10 11 16 17 20 21 24 25 29 29 30 31 33 34 38 39 42 43 45 46 51 52 54 54 55
yes , it is good , but i 've had better for cheaper .

you would think they would make up for it with service , sadly , no .
0 3 4 9 10 15 16 20 21 26 27 31 32 34 35 38 39 41 42 46 47 54 54 55 56 61 61 62 63 65 65 66
service was just ok , it is not what you 'd expect for $ 500 .

terrible waste of money . . scammers
0 8 9 14 15 17 18 23 23 24 24 25 26 34
i agree that dining at casa la femme is like no other dining experience !
0 1 2 7 8 12 13 19 20 22 23 27 28 30 31 36 37 39 40 44 45 47 48 53 54 60 61 71 71 72
but not in a good way .
0 3 4 7 8 10 11 12 13 17 18 21 21 22
i am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience .
0 1 2 4 5 13 14 22 23 25 26 30 31 36 37 39 40 44 45 50 51 53 54 58 59 60 61 64 65 75 75 76
i literally just got back home after visiting casa la femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time .
0 1 2 11 12 16 17 20 21 25 26 30 31 36 37 45 46 50 51 53 54 59 60 63 64 67 68 70 71 79 80 82 83 85 86 91 92 96 97 99 100 109 110 112 113 116 117 120 121 125 126 131 132 138 139 142 143 148 149 154 155 160 161 164 165 169 169 170
we went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different .
0 2 3 7 8 10 11 20 21 24 25 34 35 38 39 45 46 48 49 51 52 61 62 69 70 73 74 83 83 84
our visit their to say the least , was an unpleasant and costly experience !
0 3 4 9 10 15 16 18 19 22 23 26 27 32 32 33 34 37 38 40 41 51 52 55 56 62 63 73 73 74
and even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience .
0 3 4 8 9 13 14 16 17 27 28 35 36 38 39 42 43 45 46 52 53 56 57 61 62 64 65 75 76 86 86 87
we did arrive late for our reservation so i can not complain too much about the wait for a table .
0 2 3 6 7 13 14 18 19 22 23 26 27 38 39 41 42 43 44 47 48 51 52 60 61 64 65 69 70 75 76 79 80 84 85 88 89 90 91 96 96 97
although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes .
0 8 9 11 12 16 17 21 22 27 28 35 36 39 40 42 43 46 47 51 52 56 57 59 60 67 67 68
we were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited .
0 2 3 7 8 15 16 18 19 22 23 26 27 29 30 34 35 46 47 50 51 55 56 63 64 68 69 71 72 79 79 80
the place is beautiful !
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 22 22 23
the hostess was very pleasant .
0 3 4 11 12 15 16 20 21 29 29 30
however , our $ 14 drinks were were horrible !
0 7 7 8 9 12 13 14 14 16 17 23 24 28 29 33 34 42 42 43
once we finally got a table , despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed !
0 4 5 7 8 15 16 19 20 21 22 27 27 28 29 36 37 47 48 50 51 57 58 60 61 65 66 71 72 76 77 79 80 84 85 91 92 96 97 98 99 104 105 109 110 113 114 118 119 124 125 130 130 131
since we were already waiting so long , we felt we had no other choice but to accept it .
0 5 6 8 9 13 14 21 22 29 30 32 33 37 37 38 39 41 42 46 47 49 50 53 54 56 57 62 63 69 70 73 74 76 77 83 84 86 86 87
our experience did not ever get any better .
0 3 4 14 15 18 19 22 23 27 28 31 32 35 36 42 42 43
for each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink .
0 3 4 8 9 15 16 18 19 25 26 30 31 34 35 39 40 42 43 45 46 53 54 57 58 62 63 68 69 76 77 78 79 84 84 85
we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka .
0 2 3 7 8 13 14 17 18 23 24 27 28 33 34 37 38 41 42 48 49 53 54 61 62 64 65 68 69 75 76 79 80 85 86 95 96 100 101 104 105 110 110 111
after the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner .
0 5 6 9 10 13 14 18 19 20 21 26 27 32 33 36 37 40 41 47 48 52 53 57 58 63 64 67 68 74 74 75
we asked for beverages and never received them .
0 2 3 8 9 12 13 22 23 26 27 32 33 41 42 46 46 47
we asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order .
0 2 3 8 9 12 13 18 19 24 25 28 29 35 36 40 41 49 50 54 55 57 58 64 65 67 68 71 72 74 75 79 80 84 85 87 88 91 92 97 97 98
my chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin .
0 2 3 10 11 14 15 23 24 26 27 32 33 37 38 40 41 45 46 51 52 57 58 63 64 65 66 69 70 72 73 77 78 86 87 90 91 95 96 98 99 105 105 106
i would not expect this for a $ 55 dinner .
0 1 2 7 8 11 12 18 19 23 24 27 28 29 30 31 31 33 34 40 40 41
by the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage nor hooka !
0 2 3 6 7 11 12 14 15 23 24 27 28 34 35 37 38 43 44 47 48 51 52 60 61 64 65 73 74 77 78 83 83 84
what we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka . . some of which we never received !
0 4 5 7 8 11 12 14 15 18 19 24 25 26 27 32 33 38 39 46 47 49 50 51 52 57 58 65 66 69 70 77 78 81 82 86 87 90 91 97 98 101 102 107 107 108 108 109 110 114 115 117 118 123 124 126 127 132 133 141 141 142
the only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses !
0 3 4 8 9 17 18 20 21 24 25 32 33 36 37 42 43 45 46 51 52 59 59 60
to top it all off . . the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant .
0 2 3 6 7 9 10 13 14 17 17 18 18 19 20 23 24 28 29 35 36 38 39 43 44 46 47 51 52 62 63 66 67 70 71 74 75 80 81 88 89 92 93 99 100 103 104 109 110 114 115 117 118 120 121 125 126 129 130 136 137 140 141 144 145 148 149 152 153 158 159 165 166 170 171 177 178 180 181 184 185 191 192 194 195 198 199 203 204 206 207 210 211 221 222 225 226 231 232 236 237 239 240 246 247 249 250 253 254 259 260 264 265 267 268 271 272 282 282 283
by the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs and we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers !
0 2 3 6 7 11 12 14 15 19 20 23 24 31 32 36 37 41 42 45 46 48 49 53 54 57 58 66 67 70 71 73 74 80 81 84 85 89 90 92 93 97 98 106 107 109 110 113 114 123 124 127 128 134 134 135 136 141 142 147 148 152 153 157 158 168 169 171 172 174 175 178 179 181 182 187 188 191 192 202 203 205 206 210 211 215 216 219 220 225 226 233 233 234
if it seemed possible to do so while there i would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible !
0 2 3 5 6 12 13 21 22 24 25 27 28 30 31 36 37 42 43 44 45 50 51 55 56 62 63 65 66 70 71 76 77 79 80 86 87 94 95 97 98 100 101 105 106 109 110 118 118 119
i have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused , and wasted my hard earned money .

my husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended ... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly !
0 2 3 11 12 20 21 24 25 27 28 32 33 36 37 40 41 43 44 46 47 50 51 59 59 62 63 66 67 69 70 75 76 79 80 85 86 88 89 94 95 98 99 103 104 109 110 112 113 115 116 123 124 132 132 133
i wish i could be refunded !
0 1 2 6 7 8 9 14 15 17 18 26 26 27
do n't go with a larger group than 4 !
0 2 2 5 6 8 9 13 14 15 16 22 23 28 29 33 34 35 35 36
i went here for a family birthday dinner .
0 1 2 6 7 11 12 15 16 17 18 24 25 33 34 40 40 41
five of us walked in at approximately 6:20 on a thursday evening .
0 4 5 7 8 10 11 17 18 20 21 23 24 37 38 42 43 45 46 47 48 56 57 64 64 65
the hostess said `` wow that 's a large group , unless you are n't together '' , to which i replied `` no we are , and there will be one more , so a table for six please . ''
0 3 4 11 12 16 17 18 18 21 22 26 26 28 29 30 31 36 37 42 42 43 44 50 51 54 55 58 58 61 62 70 70 71 71 72 73 75 76 81 82 83 84 91 92 93 93 95 96 98 99 102 102 103 104 107 108 113 114 118 119 121 122 125 126 130 130 131 132 134 135 136 137 142 143 146 147 150 151 157 157 158 158 159
at first we were a little taken aback , as this seemed to present a problem , although the restaurant looked fairly empty , but they hastily put the table together for us .
0 2 3 8 9 11 12 16 17 18 19 25 26 31 32 37 37 38 39 41 42 46 47 53 54 56 57 64 65 66 67 74 74 75 76 84 85 88 89 99 100 106 107 113 114 119 119 120 121 124 125 129 130 137 138 141 142 145 146 151 152 160 161 164 165 167 167 168
the menu is fairly simple without much descriptions .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 18 19 25 26 33 34 38 39 51 51 52
there was no tap beer that evening , which was a disappointment .
0 5 6 9 10 12 13 16 17 21 22 26 27 34 34 35 36 41 42 45 46 47 48 62 62 63
not much of a selection of bottled beer either , we went with brahma .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 13 14 23 24 26 27 34 35 39 40 46 46 47 48 50 51 55 56 60 61 67 67 68
the appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion -lrb- maybe 3 of each -rrb- .
0 3 4 14 15 17 18 25 26 30 31 37 38 45 46 47 48 50 51 56 57 59 60 65 66 73 74 77 78 83 84 88 89 98 99 102 103 104 105 109 110 117 118 119 119 124 125 126 127 129 130 134 134 135 135 136
the lobster knuckles -lrb- special of the day -rrb- were ok , but pretty tasteless .
0 3 4 11 12 20 21 22 22 29 30 32 33 36 37 40 40 41 42 46 47 49 49 50 51 54 55 61 62 71 71 72
i believe there were 2 shrimp in the `` salt encrusted shrimp '' appetizer .

after we ate our appetizers -lrb- which took all of 8 minutes -rrb- we ordered another round of brahma 's - and tried to stall a little as we waited for our sixth dinner member .

the waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order .
0 3 4 12 13 21 22 25 26 31 32 34 35 37 38 40 41 47 48 50 51 53 54 59 60 63 64 69 69 70
we replied that we would like to wait 5 more minutes if that was okay .
0 2 3 10 11 15 16 18 19 24 25 29 30 32 33 37 38 39 40 44 45 52 53 55 56 60 61 64 65 69 69 70
she replied `` well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now , since you are a larger party , and it might get crowded . ''

i have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price -lrb- just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $ 25 -rrb- , which i would expect at a upscale indian restaurant but this place does n't have an upscale feel .

also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ .

i do n't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron 's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff -lrb- more than the price -rrb- .

not one to jump to complaints -lrb- hence my lack of previous online reviewing -rrb- , i called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations .

my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .

my girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .

authentic korean food lovers should visit 32nd street , of course .

lives up to the hype
0 5 6 8 9 11 12 15 16 20
we 've lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had dinner there .
0 2 2 5 6 11 12 18 19 22 23 29 30 34 35 39 40 45 46 49 50 54 55 56 57 61 62 65 66 73 74 77 78 84 85 90 90 91
we 've tried before but it always packed and does n't take reservations .
0 2 2 5 6 11 12 18 19 22 23 25 26 32 33 39 40 43 44 48 48 51 52 56 57 69 69 70
it was well worth the wait .
0 2 3 6 7 11 12 17 18 21 22 26 26 27
the wife had the risotto which was amazing .
0 3 4 8 9 12 13 16 17 24 25 30 31 34 35 42 42 43
it does n't look appetizing as it 's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black , but the taste was phenomenal .
0 2 3 7 7 10 11 15 16 26 27 29 30 32 32 34 35 42 43 45 46 51 52 55 56 59 60 62 63 68 69 73 74 78 79 82 83 88 89 94 94 95 96 99 100 103 104 109 110 113 114 124 124 125
the farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty .

i love margherita pizza -- i looove east village pizza
0 1 2 6 7 17 18 23 24 25 26 27 28 34 35 39 40 47 48 53
love this place , every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go .

a quintessential slice of nyc pizza .
0 1 2 16 17 22 23 25 26 29 30 35 35 36
the crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components .

possibly the most romantic restaurant in the city
0 8 9 12 13 17 18 26 27 37 38 40 41 44 45 49
this is undoubtedly my favorite modern japanese brasserie -lrb- that do n't serve sushi -rrb- , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city !
0 4 5 7 8 19 20 22 23 31 32 38 39 47 48 57 58 59 59 63 64 66 66 69 70 75 76 81 81 82 82 83 84 87 88 90 91 93 94 101 101 102 103 106 107 109 110 113 114 118 119 127 128 139 140 142 143 146 147 151 151 152
not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you 're no longer in the city .

if you 're planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you 'll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching -lrb- choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! -rrb- .

my party had the bbe $ 29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake !
0 2 3 8 9 12 13 16 17 20 21 22 22 24 25 29 30 34 35 39 39 40 41 46 47 50 51 55 56 57 58 67 68 72 73 78 79 81 82 86 87 91 92 96 97 98 99 105 106 108 109 113 113 114
i never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it .
0 1 2 7 8 12 13 15 16 18 19 20 21 24 25 27 28 33 34 37 38 40 41 47 48 61 62 66 67 69 70 71 72 75 76 80 81 84 85 87 88 97 98 99 100 106 107 112 113 115 116 118 118 119
we started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche .
0 2 3 10 11 14 15 19 20 21 22 32 33 40 41 46 47 53 53 54
our first course was tuna sashimi with green yuzu sauce .
0 3 4 9 10 16 17 20 21 25 26 33 34 38 39 44 45 49 50 55 55 56
i picked the grilled black cod as my entree , which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better .
0 1 2 8 9 12 13 20 21 26 27 30 31 33 34 36 37 43 43 44 45 50 51 52 53 63 64 72 73 78 79 86 87 96 97 101 102 105 106 113 114 120 121 125 126 129 130 136 136 137
the entrees were served with miso soup and rice .
0 3 4 11 12 16 17 23 24 28 29 33 34 38 39 42 43 47 47 48
the sake 's complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world .
0 3 4 8 8 10 11 23 24 27 28 35 36 40 41 45 46 49 50 52 53 65 66 72 73 75 76 80 81 84 85 89 90 95 95 96
for desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse -lrb- interesting but not extraordinary -rrb- and matcha -lrb- powdered green tea -rrb- and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal .
0 3 4 12 12 13 14 16 17 22 23 26 27 33 34 39 40 46 47 53 54 55 55 66 67 70 71 74 75 88 88 89 90 93 94 100 101 102 102 110 111 116 117 120 120 121 122 125 126 135 136 146 146 147 148 153 154 157 158 168 168 169
maybe it was the great company -lrb- i had friends visiting from philly -- yes , it was not a date this time -rrb- or the super reasonable price point , but i just ca n't say enough good things about this brasserie .
0 5 6 8 9 12 13 16 17 22 23 30 31 32 32 33 34 37 38 45 46 54 55 59 60 66 67 68 69 72 72 73 74 76 77 80 81 84 85 86 87 91 92 96 97 101 101 102 103 105 106 109 110 115 116 126 127 132 133 138 138 139 140 143 144 145 146 150 151 153 153 156 157 160 161 167 168 172 173 179 180 185 186 190 191 200 200 201
i do n't usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but i 'll come to zenkichi anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner .

terrible would be a compliment !
0 8 9 14 15 17 18 19 20 30 30 31
the service leaves much to be desired , from feeling like you are rushed the place your order , to being ignored the rest of the night .
0 3 4 11 12 18 19 23 24 26 27 29 30 37 37 38 39 43 44 51 52 56 57 60 61 64 65 71 72 75 76 81 82 86 87 92 92 93 94 96 97 102 103 110 111 114 115 119 120 122 123 126 127 132 132 133

we paid a fixed pricce but got nothing !!
0 2 3 7 8 9 10 15 16 22 23 26 27 30 31 38 38 40
we never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating .
0 2 3 8 9 12 13 20 21 23 24 29 30 32 33 34 35 37 38 41 42 49 50 52 53 57 58 61 62 68 69 72 73 77 78 81 82 87 88 90 91 96 97 99 100 105 106 112 112 113
they are extremely rude , not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $ 500 for some drinks adn their pita bread !

in fact there is only one i 've tried that even compares -lrb- shabu tatsu -rrb- and even then i prefer dokebi .

the meat is fresh , the sauces are great , you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too .

dokebi gives williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos .

the hot dogs are good , yes , but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich , perfect on its supermarket squishy bun .

overall the food quality was pretty good , though i hear the salmon is much better when it has n't sat cooling in front of the guest .

at $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you 're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture .

my boyfriend and i are avid restaurant goers , and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended flatbush farms .

it was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes .
0 2 3 6 7 13 14 18 19 23 23 24 25 29 30 31 32 35 36 38 39 48 49 60 61 68 69 72 73 79 80 88 88 89
my boyfriend asked me if i wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead , while he de-skinned the chicken so that i could enjoy the white meat .

i took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and i have never , in the 17 years i have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in flatbush farms .

at this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n't say anything , and guess what , the waitress walked away .
0 2 3 7 8 13 13 14 15 18 19 27 28 33 34 38 39 42 43 47 48 50 51 53 54 64 65 68 69 73 73 74 75 76 77 80 81 90 91 93 94 101 102 106 107 108 109 112 113 123 124 127 128 131 131 134 135 138 139 147 147 148 149 152 153 158 159 163 163 164 165 168 169 177 178 184 185 189 189 190
so , i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it .
0 2 2 3 4 5 6 12 13 17 18 20 21 30 31 36 37 39 40 43 44 46 47 52 53 54 55 60 61 68 69 72 73 77 78 81 82 89 90 95 95 96 97 100 101 104 105 112 113 116 117 119 120 131 132 136 137 138 139 143 144 149 150 153 154 158 159 166 167 169 169 170
i could n't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach .
0 1 2 7 7 10 11 15 16 21 22 25 26 32 33 41 42 49 50 52 53 56 57 63 64 74 75 80 81 84 85 92 93 96 97 104 104 105
i 've had better chicken at bbqs !!!!
0 1 1 4 5 8 9 15 16 23 24 26 27 31 31 35

guess what , i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , `` oh well , i wish you would have said something earlier '' no apology , nothing .

after that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another twenty minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it !!!!!!!!!!!!

i was literally going to explode , but instead , my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager .

this is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and i can not comp it .

the reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews .

sometimes you pay a lot and do n't get much in return - it 's manhattan , things are expensive .

however , most of them are at least prompt and pleasant .

the decor however seems to be the distraction so you wo n't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 frickin hours to come !!!!

how this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy , or any other for that matter , is beyond me .

only complaint is the pricing -- i believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu .

it 's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions , but we 've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years .

each time we 've been , the front of house staff -lrb- not the waiters - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you -rrb- has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes i would never return .
0 4 5 9 10 12 12 15 16 20 20 21 22 25 26 31 32 34 35 40 41 46 47 48 48 51 52 55 56 63 64 65 66 70 70 73 74 83 84 85 86 89 90 93 94 100 101 104 105 110 111 114 115 119 120 123 123 124 125 128 129 133 134 136 137 144 145 147 148 150 151 155 156 160 161 163 164 167 168 171 172 175 176 187 188 192 193 199 200 201 202 207 208 213 214 220 220 221
as bfc does n't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !

i was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a friday night because she `` had a bbq to go to '' that night - wtf ??

there 's another girl who i ca n't describe , she is about 5 ' 6 '' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're * really * talking about .

considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , i expect better service .

maitre-d - `` eat and get out ''
0 8 8 9 9 10 10 13 14 17 18 21 22 25 25 26
my family ate here last weekend .
0 2 3 9 10 13 14 18 19 23 24 31 31 32
the food and service were fine , however the maitre-d was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant .

while finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine , our son 's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert .

this guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including paris , that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant .

taking hot dogs to the next level

at first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at bark you do n't just get your average hot dog .

on the way out , we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues .

ca n't believe how an expensive nyc restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients .

what a hassle !

the food is very good , but not outstanding .
0 3 4 8 9 11 12 16 17 21 21 22 23 26 27 30 31 42 42 43
there is no way it justifies the accolades it receives , the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table .
0 5 6 8 9 11 12 15 16 18 19 28 29 32 33 42 43 45 46 54 54 55 56 59 60 68 69 71 72 75 76 81 82 84 85 88 89 93 94 97 98 99 100 105 105 106
on our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table .
0 2 3 6 7 11 12 17 17 18 19 23 24 31 32 36 37 40 41 45 46 48 49 52 53 57 57 58 59 66 67 69 70 77 78 80 81 86 87 91 92 95 96 97 98 103 103 104
mistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a glass of wine ... but not the grunt that we received from the al di la staff .

without the wait or attitude , i would probably go back , but there are just too many other restaurants in brooklyn that are as good or better and do n't make me jump through hoops .

i went there after hearing how great it was .

wow .
0 3 3 4
the bread was stale , the salad was overpriced and empty .
0 3 4 9 10 13 14 19 19 20 21 24 25 30 31 34 35 45 46 49 50 55 55 56
the pasta was well cooked , did n't have enough sauce though or flavor .
0 3 4 9 10 13 14 18 19 25 25 26 27 30 30 33 34 38 39 45 46 51 52 58 59 61 62 68 68 69
i though it was expensive and i prefer bella via just blocks away by far .

i was one of the people that went for this horrible experience .
0 1 2 5 6 9 10 12 13 16 17 23 24 28 29 33 34 37 38 42 43 51 52 62 62 63
my friend is 100 % right in the experience we had .

the hostess was rude and i got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us .
0 3 4 11 12 15 16 20 21 24 25 26 27 30 31 32 33 41 42 49 50 54 55 59 60 63 64 67 68 72 73 75 76 81 82 84 84 85
the only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared .
0 3 4 8 9 14 15 19 20 22 23 29 30 34 35 38 39 41 42 46 47 51 52 54 55 58 59 63 64 66 67 70 71 74 75 78 79 88 89 100 100 101
i asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like i was insane .
0 1 2 7 8 11 12 13 14 18 19 22 23 26 27 31 32 40 41 47 48 50 51 53 54 58 59 60 61 64 65 71 71 72
i was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said , `` can i help you '' and `` how many are in your party . ''

what ?

the three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were .
0 3 4 9 10 12 13 15 16 24 25 27 28 33 34 36 37 40 41 47 48 52 53 57 58 60 61 71 72 74 75 78 79 83 84 86 87 89 90 95 96 100 100 101
we did n't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately i think that may have been part of the problem .

i was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter .
0 1 2 5 6 11 12 15 16 22 23 31 31 32 33 36 37 39 40 44 45 48 49 55 56 58 59 60 61 69 70 73 74 75 76 82 82 83
the waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand .
0 3 4 10 11 20 21 24 25 29 30 35 36 43 44 48 49 57 58 60 61 63 64 65 66 73 74 77 78 80 81 88 89 91 92 95 96 100 100 101
i ca n't believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering food !
0 1 2 4 4 7 8 15 16 20 21 23 24 27 27 28 29 32 33 39 40 43 44 47 48 51 52 56 57 63 64 74 75 79 79 80
the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating -lrb- a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to ignore it -rrb- .
0 3 4 12 13 17 18 20 21 26 27 29 30 32 33 35 36 41 42 45 46 53 53 54 55 58 59 64 65 67 68 73 74 77 78 84 85 90 91 95 96 98 99 101 102 106 107 112 113 119 120 121 121 122 123 126 127 130 131 136 137 139 140 144 145 149 150 157 158 164 165 175 175 176 177 179 180 181 182 185 186 188 189 195 196 198 198 199 199 200
i could n't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table .
0 1 2 7 7 10 11 17 18 21 22 26 27 31 32 35 36 41 42 46 47 50 51 56 57 59 60 63 64 66 67 69 70 77 77 78 79 82 83 86 87 89 90 93 94 98 98 99 100 102 103 108 109 112 113 118 118 119
she then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables .

i wish i could like this place more , and i wish someone would retrain the staff .
